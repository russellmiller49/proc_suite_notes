"Ok so this was a 71 year old lady with prior left upper lobectomy who's got new subsolid nodules in the right upper lobe, three of them, plus some borderline lymphadenopathy and a left adrenal mass on PET. We used the Ion robot to hit all three RUL targets - first one apical segment about 8mm, second one also apical but more central about 1.1cm, third one posterior segment subpleural 1.1cm. Each target got the full workup - cone beam CT to confirm position, needle aspiration with 21 and 23 gauge, cryo biopsies with the 1.1mm probe, brushings, and mini BALs. Placed fiducials at each site too. Then did EBUS with elastography on everything - 4R and 4L looked benign type 1 so we left them alone. Sampled 11L, station 7, 11Rs, and 11Ri. Then flipped to EUS-B for the left adrenal mass, got 4 passes with 25 gauge, ROSE said lesional but saw a small hematoma forming so we stopped. Checked the esophagus and stomach on the way in, all normal. No complications."

"Alright so 71 year old female she had a left upper lobectomy before now she's got these new ground glass nodules in the right upper lobe three of them and an adrenal mass we need to work up. Started with airway exam everything looked normal except you could see the LUL stump which was fine and the left mainstem was a little tortuous. RUL had a 4-airway variant. Moderate thin secretions suctioned out. Switched to Ion did three targets all in the right upper lobe the first two in the apical segment one peripheral one more central and the third in posterior segment subpleural. Each one we did cone beam confirmed position then needles cryo brush and mini BAL. Placed fiducials at all three. Then EBUS with elastography everywhere. The 4R and 4L were soft type 1 so we didn't sample. Sampled 11L which was type 2, station 7 and 11Rs and 11Ri which were all type 1 but we sampled anyway for staging. Then went down into the esophagus stomach looked fine did EUS-B on the left adrenal it was type 2 on elastography got 4 passes ROSE called it lesional but there was a little hematoma forming so we stopped there. All good no pneumothorax no complications."

**8. Narrative/story style**
"Seventy-one year old woman, previous left upper lobectomy, now with three new subsolid nodules in the right upper lobe that are growing, some borderline lymph nodes, and a concerning left adrenal mass on PET. We brought her to the OR under general, intubated her. Airway exam showed a nice clean LUL stump, tortuous left mainstem, and a four-way branching variant in the RUL. Suctioned moderate secretions. Fired up the Ion robot and went after all three nodules. The first was a small 8mm ground glass in the apical segment, the second a slightly larger 11mm one also apical but more central, and the third an 11mm subpleural one in the posterior segment. At every site we confirmed position with cone beam CT, did needle aspiration with both 21 and 23 gauge, cryobiopsies with the little 1.1mm probe, brushings, and mini-BALs, then dropped a fiducial. Radial EBUS showed concentric pattern at all three. ROSE showed atypical cells at sites 1 and 3, just blood at site 2. Did full BALs from both segments after. Then switched to linear EBUS and did elastography on all the nodes. 4R and 4L were soft and benign-looking so we skipped them. Sampled 11L which had a mixed type 2 pattern, and also sampled station 7, 11Rs, and 11Ri even though they looked type 1 just for completeness. Quick EGD was normal. Then advanced for EUS-B of the left adrenal - type 2 elastography, got 4 needle passes with 25 gauge, ROSE said lesional which is great, but we noticed a small hematoma forming so called it there. Checked the esophagus again on the way out, no bleeding. No pneumothorax, no complications, extubated in the OR."

"Hey so for this case - she's 71 with a prior LUL lobectomy and now has three growing subsolid nodules all in the right upper lobe plus borderline mediastinal nodes and a hot adrenal on PET. We used the Ion for all three peripheral targets. First target RB1 apical about 8mm, second also RB1 but more central 11mm, third RB2 posterior 11mm subpleural. Standard workup at each one - cone beam to confirm, needles 21 and 23 gauge 7 passes each, cryo with the 1.1 probe 7-8 biopsies, brush, mini BAL, and fiducial. Radial showed concentric at all three. ROSE had atypical cells at 1 and 3, blood at 2. Did formal BALs at RB1 and RB2 after. Then EBUS - we did elastography on every node. 4R and 4L were type 1 soft so attending decided not to sample. 11L was type 2 mixed so definitely sampled that one. Also sampled station 7 and both 11R nodes even though type 1 for staging purposes. Four passes each with 25 and 21 gauge. Quick EGD was clean. Then EUS-B for the adrenal - type 2 on elastography, 4 passes with 25 gauge, ROSE called it lesional but there was a hematoma developing so we stopped. Post-procedure fluoro and scope check all clear. 22 modifier for sure given three discrete robotic targets plus 7 elastography sites."

**15. Attending summary to tumor board style**
"Performed combined robotic navigational bronchoscopy, EBUS with elastography, and EUS-B on a 71F with prior LUL lobectomy presenting with three new/growing subsolid nodules in the RUL plus borderline mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a PET-avid left adrenal mass. All three RUL targets were biopsied using the Ion platform with cone beam CT confirmation - two in the apical segment and one in the posterior segment. Each site received comprehensive tissue acquisition including TBNA, cryobiopsy, brushings, and lavage with fiducial placement. ROSE showed atypical cells at sites 1 and 3. Systematic mediastinal and hilar staging with EBUS elastography was performed at 6 stations; 4R and 4L appeared benign (type 1) and were not sampled, while 11L showed mixed type 2 pattern and was sampled along with station 7, 11Rs, and 11Ri. The left adrenal mass was accessed via EUS-B and showed type 2 elastography with ROSE reading lesional after 4 passes. Small hematoma formed so sampling was stopped. Awaiting final pathology."
