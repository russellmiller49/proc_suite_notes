Did a bronch on a 71 year old woman with abnormal CT and neutropenic fever. We did therapeutic aspiration and bilateral BAL. Also had pleural fluid on CT so we consented for thoracentesis but ended up not doing it. Moderate sedation with 2 of versed and 75 of fentanyl, started at 3:40pm ended 4:04pm. Used a disposable scope. Patient supine. Put 6 of lido on the cords. Airways looked normal bilaterally down to subsegments. RML was fishmouthed but mucosa was fine. Suctioned out mucus plugs from LB1/2, LB3, RB1 and RB2. BAL'd the RB2 with 80cc got back 15, then BAL'd LB1/2 with 60cc got back 15. Sent everything for cell count, cultures, viral, fungal, and cytology. No complications. Follow up on cultures.

OK so this is a 71 year old lady with an abnormal CT chest and she's neutropenic with fevers. We took her for a bronch. Did therapeutic aspiration and bilateral BAL. We had also planned a thoracentesis because she had some pleural fluid on CT but we ended up not doing that one. Moderate sedation, gave her 2 of versed and 75 of fentanyl. Started sedation at 3:40 stopped at 4:04 so 24 minutes total. Used the disposable scope. She was supine. Squirted 6 mLs of lido on her cords. Everything looked normal down to subsegments on both sides. The RML was fishmouthed but otherwise the mucosa was normal looking. There were mucus plugs in LB1/2, LB3, RB1 and RB2 that we aspirated out. Then we did BAL at RB2, put in 80 cc of saline got back 15. Did another BAL at LB1/2, put in 60 got back 15. Sent it all for cell count, micro including cultures viral and fungal, and cytology. No complications, no bleeding. She did great. Just need to follow up the cultures. Diagnosis is R91.8 both pre and post op.

Performed bronchoscopy on a 71-year-old female presenting with abnormal chest CT and neutropenic fevers. Diagnosis R91.8 pre and post. Consent was obtained. Procedures included therapeutic aspiration and diagnostic BAL bilaterally. We had consented for thoracentesis as well given pleural fluid on imaging but this was not started. Moderate sedation with 2mg versed and 75mcg fentanyl, face-to-face time 1540 to 1604 totaling 24 minutes. Disposable bronchoscope used with patient supine. Applied 6mL lidocaine to the vocal cords. Airway inspection normal bilaterally to subsegmental level. RML appeared fishmouthed with otherwise normal mucosa. Therapeutic aspiration performed clearing mucus plugs from LB1/2, LB3, RB1 and RB2. BAL at RB2 with 80cc instilled and 15cc returned. BAL at LB1/2 with 60cc instilled and 15cc returned. Specimens sent for cell count, microbiology including cultures viral and fungal, and cytology. No blood loss or complications. Bilateral modifier on the BAL since we washed both RUL and LUL due to neutropenic fever and concern for infection. Plan to follow up culture results.
