**Prompt 3 (Voice-dictation style, conversational)**
Okay so this is a 68 year old guy with a persistent air leak. We did a bronch under general. Used the therapeutic flex scope and the peds hybrid scope. First we aspirated a bunch of mucus and mucus plugs from the right mainstem, bronchus intermedius, and left mainstem. Then did BAL in the lingula, LB4 and LB5, instilled 60 cc of saline got back 15, sent for cell count micro and cytology. Same thing at RB9 in the right lower lobe, 60 in 15 back same labs. Then we did serial occlusion with an Arndt 7 French blocker and a Fogarty balloon and isolated the air leak to the RLL lateral and posterior subsegments. We reproduced the leak with an inspiratory hold at 30 and suction on the pleurovac at negative 20. Used 2 cc of Tisseel to block off a posterior branch subsegment of the RLL. Tried a size 7 spiration valve in RB10 but it was too big so we pulled it. Put a size 6 in RB9 good position. Put a size 6 in RB10 but bad position so we pulled it and put another size 6 in at a better angle. Final is size 6 in RB9 and size 6 in RB10. Air leak significantly decreased. Dr Thistlethwaite did the VATS and pleurodesis see his note. No complications, patient extubated in OR went to recovery stable. Two BAL specimens. Follow up on BAL and 6 weeks for valve removal. Oh and modifier 22 because we did BAL in multiple lobes.

**Prompt 8 (Narrative style, complete sentences)**
Performed bronchoscopy on a 68 year old male with persistent air leak under general anesthesia. Used the flexible therapeutic bronchoscope and the flexible hybrid pediatric bronchoscope. Started by aspirating mucus and mucus plugs from the right mainstem, bronchus intermedius, and left mainstem. Performed BAL at the superior and inferior segments of the lingula, LB4 and LB5, instilling 60 cc of normal saline with 15 cc return, sent for cell count, microbiology, and cytology. Also did BAL at the lateral basal segment of the RLL, RB9, same volumes and same labs sent. Next performed serial occlusion using an Arndt 7 French endobronchial blocker and a Fogarty balloon and isolated the air leak to the lateral and posterior subsegments of the RLL. Reproduced the leak with an inspiratory hold at 30 and pleurovac suction at negative 20 cm water. Applied 2 cc of Tisseel to a posterior branch subsegment of the RLL. Attempted a size 7 spiration valve in RB10 but it was too large so it was removed. Placed a size 6 spiration valve in RB9 in good position. Placed size 6 in RB10 in poor position so it was removed and replaced with another size 6 at a better angle. Final configuration is size 6 valves in RB9 and RB10. Air leak significantly decreased. Dr. Thistlethwaite performed VATS and pleurodesis separately. No complications, patient extubated in OR and transported to recovery in stable condition. Two BAL specimens collected. Plan to follow up BAL results and remove valves in 6 weeks. Modifier 22 for BAL in multiple lobes.

**Prompt 15 (Dictation with filler words)**
Um so this was a 68 year old male with a persistent air leak. We took him to the OR, general anesthesia. I used, uh, the flexible therapeutic bronchoscope and also the flexible hybrid peds scope. First thing we did was suction out all the mucus and mucus plugs from the right mainstem, the bronchus intermedius, and the left mainstem. Then, uh, we did a BAL in the lingula, that's LB4 and LB5, put in 60 cc of normal saline, got 15 back, sent it for cell count, micro, and cytology. Did the same thing at RB9, lateral basal segment of the right lower lobe, 60 in 15 back, same labs. Then we needed to figure out where the leak was, so we did serial occlusion with an Arndt 7 French and a Fogarty balloon. We, uh, isolated it to the lateral and posterior subsegments of the RLL. Confirmed the leak with an inspiratory hold at 30 and pleurovac suction at negative 20. Used 2 cc of Tisseel in the posterior branch subsegment. Then for the valves, tried a size 7 spiration in RB10 but it was too big, so we pulled it. Size 6 in RB9, that looked good. Size 6 in RB10 was in a bad position so we had to pull it and put another size 6 in at a better angle. So final configuration, uh, size 6 in RB9 and size 6 in RB10. Air leak was significantly decreased after that. Dr. Thistlethwaite did the VATS and pleurodesis, see his note. No complications. Patient was extubated in the OR and went to recovery in stable condition. Two BAL specimens. Plan is follow up on BAL and remove valves in 6 weeks. And modifier 22 because BAL was done in multiple lobes.

**Prompt 17 (Mixed narrative and data)**
Did a bronch on a 68 year old male for persistent air leak, general anesthesia. Two scopes: therapeutic flex and the peds hybrid. Cleared out mucus plugs from RMS, BI, and LMS. BAL data: LB4/LB5 got 60cc in and 15cc back, RB9 got 60cc in and 15cc back. All sent for cell count, microbiology including cultures viral fungal, and cytology. Air leak localization: used arndt 7fr endobronchial blocker and fogarty balloon for serial occlusion. Leak came from RLL lateral and posterior subsegments. Confirmed by inspiratory hold at 30 with pleurovac at -20cmH2O. Treatment: tisseel 2cc in posterior branch subsegment of RLL. Then placed spiration valves. Size 7 in RB10 didn't fit (too big), removed. Size 6 in RB9 perfect. Size 6 in RB10 wrong angle, had to pull and redo with another size 6. Ended with size 6 in RB9 and RB10. Air leak significantly better. Thistlethwaite did the VATS and pleurodesis part. No complications, extubated in OR, stable to PACU. Specimens: 2 BALs. Following up on BAL results and removing valves at 6 weeks. Modifier 22 for BAL in multiple lobes.

**Prompt 19 (Attending-to-fellow teaching style)**
Alright so for your note on this one: 68 year old male, indication is persistent air leak. General anesthesia. We used two scopes, the flex therapeutic and the peds hybrid. Remember to document that we aspirated mucus and plugs from the right mainstem, BI, and left mainstem first. Then we did two BALs - one in the lingula at LB4 and LB5, and one at RB9 in the right lower lobe. Both were 60 cc of saline in with 15 cc return, and we sent everything for cell count, micro, and cytology. For the air leak workup, we did serial occlusion with the Arndt 7 French and the Fogarty, and localized it to the lateral and posterior subsegments of the RLL. Make sure you document the inspiratory hold at 30 and pleurovac at negative 20 to confirm the leak. We used 2 cc of Tisseel on the posterior subsegment. For valves, note that we tried a 7 in RB10 first but it was too big and had to come out. The 6 in RB9 was good. The first 6 in RB10 was at a bad angle so we swapped it for another 6 in a better position. Final is size 6 in both RB9 and RB10. Leak was way down after. Thistlethwaite did the VATS and pleurodesis, reference his note. No complications, extubated in OR, stable to recovery. Two BAL specimens. Follow up on labs and 6 weeks for valve removal. And don't forget modifier 22 for the multi-lobe BAL.
