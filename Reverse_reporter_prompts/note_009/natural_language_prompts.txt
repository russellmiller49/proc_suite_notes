29 year old guy with airway stenosis. Put him under general, used the therapeutic flex bronch. Airway had significant pressure and the stent had migrated distally. Suctioned out mucus from the whole trachea, both mainstems and the BI. Did a BAL in the RML segments RB4 and RB5, put in 20 of saline got back 10, sent for cell count and cultures. Found the BonaStent 14x60 sitting in the distal trachea as a foreign body, pulled it out with forceps. There was a ton of hair at the graft causing obstruction and trapping mucus, had to mechanically pull all that out with forceps too. Then dealt with granulation tissue in the subglottic area using APC at 1.5mm pulse 20 effect 2 flow 0.3 for a couple seconds each pass. Airway went from 60 to 90 percent patent. No bleeding no complications. Extubated in the OR and sent to recovery in good shape. Keep him on critical airway watch tonight, think about CPAP if he tanks, chest xray in the morning. This was a modifier 22 case - the hair removal made it way more work than usual, apply to the biopsy and excision codes.

Hey so I just finished this 29 year old with airway stenosis. General anesthesia, flex therapeutic scope. His stent had migrated down into the distal trachea so I pulled that out - it was a BonaStent 14 by 60. Before that I aspirated mucus from the whole trachea and both mainstems plus the BI. Did a lavage in the right middle lobe RB4 and RB5, 20 in 10 back, sent the usual cell count and cultures. The big issue was a ton of hair at the graft site causing obstruction and trapping mucus - spent a lot of time pulling that out mechanically. Then APC'd some granulation tissue in the subglottic region, 1.5mm probe pulse 20 effect 2 flow 0.3 for a couple seconds. Airway opened up from 60 to 90 percent. No complications. He's extubated and in recovery. Put him on critical airway watch tonight, CPAP if he needs it, chest film in the morning. Definitely a modifier 22 case because of all the hair - apply to the biopsy and excision codes.

Patient is a 29-year-old male presenting with airway stenosis. Procedure performed under general anesthesia using a flexible therapeutic bronchoscope. On initial inspection the airway was stable with significant airway pressure and the stent was noted to have migrated distally. Therapeutic aspiration was performed in the proximal middle and distal trachea as well as the right mainstem bronchus intermedius and left mainstem to clear mucus. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at the lateral and medial segments of the right middle lobe RB4 and RB5 with 20 cc of normal saline instilled and 10 cc returned. Samples were sent for cell count and microbiology including cultures viral and fungal studies. A BonaStent measuring 14 by 60 was identified as a foreign body in the distal trachea and was removed with forceps. A significant amount of hair was found at the graft level causing endobronchial obstruction with mucus trapping and was mechanically removed with forceps. Granulation tissue was identified in the subglottic region and was treated with argon plasma coagulation using a 1.5 mm probe at pulse 20 effect 2 and flow 0.3 for 2 to 3 second applications. The affected airway improved from 60 percent to 90 percent patency. There was no blood loss and no complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition. Specimens include the BonaStent and BAL from the right middle lobe. Plan is for critical airway watch overnight with consideration of CPAP if respiratory failure develops and follow-up chest x-ray in the morning. Modifier 22 applies to the endobronchial biopsy and excision codes due to the hair removal requiring greater than 40 percent increased work.

just finished the 29yo stenosis case. stent had migrated into the distal trachea so pulled that bonastent 14x60 out. suctioned a ton of mucus from the whole airway. did a BAL in the RML rb4 and rb5, 20cc in 10 back. the wild part was there was a bunch of hair growing at the graft that was blocking everything and trapping mucus. spent a long time pulling it all out mechanically. also had to APC some granulation tissue subglottic, 1.5mm probe pulse 20 effect 2 flow 0.3. airway went from 60 to 90 percent. no issues. hes extubated and in recovery. going to watch him overnight on critical airway, cpap if he needs it, cxr in the am. definitely modifier 22 on the biopsy and excision codes bc of that hair situation
