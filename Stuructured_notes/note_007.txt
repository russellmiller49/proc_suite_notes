INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 68-year-old male who presents with persistent airleak. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None

COMPLICATIONS None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). Patient Position: [Position]

Initial Airway Inspection and Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus and mucus plug.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (Lingula) Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at the Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5). Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (RLL) Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at the Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9). Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Bronchopleural Fistula Localization Serial occlusion with endobronchial blocker (Arndt 7Fr) and Fogarty balloon was done to isolate the airleak to be at the RLL (Lateral and Posterior subsegment). Airleak was reproduced with inspiratory hold at 30 and suction on pleurovac on -20cmH20.

Endobronchial Sealant Application Tisseel 2cc was used to block off a subsegment of the RLL posterior branch.

Endobronchial Valve Placement

RB10: A Size 7 Spiration valve was placed but noted to be too large for the airway (RB10). This was subsequently removed.

RB9: A Size 6 Spiration valve was placed in RB9, in good position.

RB10 (Exchange): Then a size 6 Spiration valve was placed in RB10, noted to be in poor position; this was removed again and replaced with another size 6 Spiration valve in a better angle.

Final Valve Configuration

RB9 - size 6 Spiration valve

RB10 - size 6 Spiration valve

The airleak was significantly decreased. See Dr. Thistlethwaite's note for VATS and pleurodesis.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
