INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] INDICATION FOR OPERATION [Patient Name] is a 33-year-old female who presents with aspergilloma and hemoptysis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient wished to proceed, and informed consent was obtained. 

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. Consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field

Aspergilloma

Hemoptysis

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field

Aspergilloma

Hemoptysis

PROCEDURE

Therapeutic aspiration of tracheobronchial tree (CPT 31645) 

Therapeutic injection via endoscope channel (Amphotericin) (CPT 31573)

Destruction of tumor/relief of stenosis by cryotherapy (CPT 31641) 

Bronchoscopy with application of Tranexamic Acid (CPT 31899)

ANESTHESIA Moderate sedation was administered. The patient was monitored continuously by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered. 

Medications: Etomidate 20 mg, Rocuronium 26 mg, Propofol 40 mcg/kg/min, Fentanyl 150 mcg/hr.

Duration: 50 minutes.

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure. 

INSTRUMENTATION Disposable Bronchoscope; 1.1mm Cryoprobe.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimal 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and procedure location. 

Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was introduced through the tracheostomy tube. The tracheostomy tube was found to be in good position. A Uniblocker was noted in place (deflated) at the Left Mainstem Bronchus (LMSB).

Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal. Main carina sharp. 

Right Lung: Proximal airways demonstrated normal anatomic branching to the segmental level. No evidence of mass or lesions. 

Left Lung: Proximal airways demonstrated normal anatomic branching to the segmental level. No evidence of mass or lesions. 

Secretions: Mild bloody secretions were noted, with left greater than right.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the airway segments from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 

Segments Cleared: Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2).

Therapeutic Injection (Amphotericin) Amphotericin B (50 mg in 20 cc sterile water) was instilled into the Left Upper Lobe (LUL) as follows:

10 cc into the apico-posterior subsegment (LB1/2).

10 cc into the anterior subsegment (LB3).

Endobronchial Hemostasis Post-instillation, the patient had a mild ooze of fresh blood. Hemostasis was achieved by applying Tranexamic Acid (TXA) directly into the LUL through the bronchoscope (Total dose: 1000 mg). 

Cryo-Extraction of Clot A formalized clot was identified causing obstruction at the LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1) and Left Carina (LC2). A 1.1 mm cryoprobe was applied to the clot with freeze times of 5–10 seconds. Excellent clot removal was achieved, and the airway obstruction was relieved. 

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

33-year-old female with aspergilloma and hemoptysis.

Successful therapeutic aspiration and clearance of bloody secretions.

Successful instillation of Amphotericin into LUL (LB1/2 and LB3).

Effective clot extraction via cryoprobe and hemostasis achieved with TXA.

Plan:

Continued care per primary team.

May consider repeat instillation of Amphotericin on 1/5/2026 and possible clot extraction.
