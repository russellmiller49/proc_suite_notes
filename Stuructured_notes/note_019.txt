POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Complicated Effusion 

PROCEDURE

Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation (CPT 76604)

Instillation(s), via chest tube/catheter, agent for fibrinolysis; initial day (CPT 32561)

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure. 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After induction of anesthesia (local), a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and laterality. 

Focused Thoracic Ultrasound Focused thoracic ultrasound was performed and relevant procedural images were saved to the medical record. 

Left Hemithorax:

Pleural Effusion: Minimal volume, anechoic echogenicity, no loculations.

Diaphragm: Normal motion.

Lung/Pleura: Lung sliding present pre- and post-procedure. No consolidation/atelectasis. Pleura appears normal.

Right Hemithorax:

Pleural Effusion: Large volume, anechoic echogenicity, thick loculations.

Diaphragm: Diminished motion.

Lung/Pleura: Pleura appears thick.

Intrapleural Fibrinolysis (Right) The existing right-sided chest tube (inserted 9/24/25) was identified.

Agent Instilled: 10 mg tPA / 5 mg DNase (Dose #1).

Dwell Time: The agents were allowed to dwell for 1 hour.

Drainage: Following the dwell time, drainage was performed using a vacutainer.

Output: 400 cc of bloody fluid was drained.

COMPLICATIONS No immediate complications occurred.
