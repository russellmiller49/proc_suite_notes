PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and laterality. 

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus. 

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed in the Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5) with saline instilled and returned.  Specimens were submitted. Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology. 

Endobronchial Biopsy Endobronchial biopsies were obtained with hemostasis achieved.  Tissue was submitted for pathology. No immediate bleeding was observed.  Performed at Right Mainstem. Lesion was successfully removed. Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology. 

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
