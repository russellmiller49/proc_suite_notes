POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Lung Transplant status

Mild airway distortion bilaterally

Transbronchial Biopsy (TBBX) of RLL lateral basal segment (10 samples)

Fluoroscopic guidance

ATTENDING [Name]

ASSISTANT [Name]

RN: [Name]

RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA Moderate IV sedation with: Fentanyl 50 mcg and Versed 2.5 mg. Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~20mL intratracheal. Sedation time: 24 minutes.

MONITORING Continuous telemetry, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Olympus Video Bronchoscope

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 5 mL

COMPLICATIONS None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL Immediately prior to the procedure a "time out" was called to verify the correct patient, procedure, equipment, support staff, and site/side marked as required.

After the patient was properly positioned and sedated and topical anesthesia applied, the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times. This was done without difficulty.

Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position, and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated, and suctioned free of secretions. Close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size, and patency.

General Findings: Mild distortion of airways noted bilaterally. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or other intra-bronchial pathology. Mucosa was normal. Secretions were minimal; therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear.

Upper Airway: Pharynx, Larynx, Vocal Cords, and Trachea were all normal. Carina was sharp.

Right Lung: Normal anastomosis; no strictures, ischemia, or black eschar.

Left Lung: Normal anastomosis; no strictures, ischemia, or black eschar.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed in the following segments with saline instilled and returned:

RML: 60 cc instilled, 20 cc returned.

LLL: 60 cc instilled, 20 cc returned. Specimens were sent for microbiology and pathology.

Transbronchial Biopsy (TBBX) Transbronchial forceps biopsies were performed under fluoroscopic guidance (Fluoro time: 28 seconds).

Target: RLL, lateral basal segment.

Samples: 10 attempts were made and 10 samples were successfully obtained.

SPECIMENS

BAL RML – Microbiology/Pathology

BAL LLL – Microbiology/Pathology

RLL lateral basal segment TBBX (10 samples) – Pathology

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX performed under moderate sedation.

Normal anastomoses bilaterally with mild airway distortion; no signs of ischemia or stricture.

Post-procedure exam: CTA over the area of the lavage and biopsy. No voice change, crepitus, dyspnea, or chest pain noted.

Samples sent for microbiology and pathology.
