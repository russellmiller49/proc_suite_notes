INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [Patient Name] is a patient who presents for flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX for lung transplant surveillance. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. 

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form, and the consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Lung Transplant 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Lung Transplant surveillance 

Normal anastomoses bilaterally

No evidence of rejection or infection on gross inspection

PROCEDURE

Flexible Bronchoscopy 

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) x2 

Transbronchial Biopsy (TBBX) 

ATTENDING [Name] 

ASSISTANT [Name] 

SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name] 

ANESTHESIA Moderate IV sedation with: fentanyl 50 mcg and Versed 2 mg; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via atomizer. Sedation time was 15 min. 

MONITORING Continuous telemetry, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. 

INSTRUMENTATION Olympus Video Bronchoscope. 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, equipment, support staff, and site/side marked as required. 

Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 administered at all times. The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position, and texture. 


Pharynx, Larynx, Vocal Cords, Trachea: Normal. 

Right Lung: Normal anastomosis; no strictures, ischemia, or black eschar observed.

Left Lung: Normal anastomosis; no strictures, ischemia, or black eschar observed.

Mucosa: Normal throughout.

Secretions: None.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed with saline instilled and returned. Specimens were sent for analysis.


BAL 1 (LLL): Instilled 50 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc. 


BAL 2 (RLL): Instilled 50 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc.  Samples sent for cytology (to check for recurrent CA), microbiology, and pathology.

Transbronchial Lung Biopsy Transbronchial forceps biopsies were performed.


RLL: 11 biopsies were attempted and 11 samples were obtained from the RLL. 

Hemostasis was achieved. EBL: None.

Post-Procedure The patient tolerated the procedure well.  Post-procedure exam demonstrated the patient was CTA (Clear to Auscultation) over the area of lavage and biopsy, with no voice change or crepitus noted. No dyspnea or chest pain was reported.

SPECIMENS

BAL 1 (LLL) — Microbiology, Pathology, Cytology 

BAL 2 (RLL) — Microbiology, Pathology, Cytology 

RLL Transbronchial Biopsy (11 samples) — Pathology 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX performed under moderate sedation. 

Normal bilateral anastomoses; no strictures, ischemia, or black eschar.

Lavage from both sides included cytology to rule out recurrent CA. 

Await final microbiology and pathology results.
