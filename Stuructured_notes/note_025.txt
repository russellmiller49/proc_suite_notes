INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] INDICATION FOR OPERATION Lung Transplant.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Lung Transplant surveillance

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Lung Transplant with normal anastomosis

No evidence of rejection or infection on gross inspection

PROCEDURE

Flexible bronchoscopy

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)

Transbronchial Biopsy (TBBX)

ATTENDING [Name]

ANESTHESIA Moderate IV sedation with: Fentanyl 50 mcg and Versed 2 mg; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via atomizer. Sedation time was 15 min during this procedure.

MONITORING Continuous telemetry, BP and oxygen saturation monitored.

INSTRUMENTATION Olympus Video Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None.

COMPLICATIONS None.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL Immediately prior to procedure a "time out" was called to verify the correct patient, procedure, equipment, support staff and site/side marked as required.

After the patient was properly positioned and sedated and topical anesthesia applied, the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times. This was done without difficulty.

Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions and close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size and patency.

Pharynx: Normal

Larynx: Normal

Vocal Cords: Normal

Trachea: Normal

Carina: Sharp

Right Lung: Normal anastomosis, no strictures, ischemia or black eschar.

Left Lung: Normal anastomosis, no strictures, ischemia or black eschar.

Mucosa: Normal.

Secretions: None.

No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other intra-bronchial pathology was observed.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed in the RML with saline instilled and returned. Specimens were submitted.

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc.

Transbronchial Lung Biopsy Transbronchial forceps biopsies were performed with a total of 11 samples collected. Specimens were submitted.

Performed at the RML.

11 TBBX attempted and 11 samples obtained.

SPECIMENS

BAL: RML (microbiology and pathology)

Biopsies: RML (pathology)

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX under moderate sedation.

Samples sent for microbiology and pathology.

Post-Procedure: No dyspnea, chest pain or changes to voice.

Exam: CTA (Clear To Auscultation) over the area of the lavage and biopsy, no voice change or crepitus noted.
