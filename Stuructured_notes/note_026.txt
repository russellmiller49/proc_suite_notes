INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY PROCEDURAL REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] PATIENT: [REDACTED] MRN: [MRN] DOB: [Date of Birth] (Age: 30) SEX: Male

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE The patient is a 30-year-old male who presents with a complicated effusion. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the chest ultrasound were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed, and informed consent was obtained. 

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS Complicated Effusion

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS Complicated Effusion; improving atelectasis.

PROCEDURE Focused Thoracic Ultrasound (Pleura & Lung) (CPT 76604) 

ANESTHESIA/MONITORING No sedation required. Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure. 

COMPLICATIONS None.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL Focused Thoracic Ultrasound (Pleura & Lung) Focused thoracic ultrasound was performed and archived.  The patient was positioned in the sitting position. The following findings were documented:

Left Hemithorax:


Pleural Effusion: A minimal volume effusion was identified. 


Character: The fluid was anechoic with thin loculations noted. 


Lung: Lung sliding was present before the procedure.  Atelectasis has improved compared to the previous day.


Diaphragm: Normal diaphragmatic motion was observed. 


Pleura: The pleura appeared normal. 

Right Hemithorax:

Not assessed during this focused exam.

Summary of Findings: Imaging revealed a trace posterior collection which has decreased compared to the previous day. There was no significantly drainable fluid identified.

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Focused chest ultrasound of the left hemithorax demonstrates a minimal, anechoic effusion with thin loculations. 

Atelectasis is improved with no drainable fluid amenable to further intervention at this time.

Plan: Discontinue chest tube.

The patient tolerating the procedure well with no immediate complications.
