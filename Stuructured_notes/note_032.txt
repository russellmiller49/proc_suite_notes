INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 73-year-old male who presents with lung mass, multiple lung nodules, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, and LLL lobar atelectasis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient or surrogate in detail. Patient or surrogate indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field

PROCEDURE

Navigational Bronchoscopy (computer assisted) with Ion Robotic Bronchoscope (LUL and RML)

Radiology guidance for CT guided needle placement (Cios Spin)

3D rendering with interpretation and reporting (Ion Planning Station)

Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion

Fiducial marker placement

Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of LUL and RML targets

Transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBBX) of LUL and RML targets

Transbronchial brushing and Mini-BAL

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of LUL, RML, and LLL

Therapeutic aspiration (initial episode) for clot/mucus clearance

EBUS sampling 3 or more nodes (Stations 11Ri, 11Rs, 4R, 7)

Ultrasound Elastography (First and Additional Targets)

Destruction of tumor (Cryotherapy and APC) at LLL

31899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)

MODIFIER 22 (INCREASED PROCEDURAL SERVICES) This patient required Transbronchial Cryo biopsies at two different locations, Robotic Navigation to two different sites (LEFT upper lobe and RIGHT middle lobe), CT-guided needle placement at two locations, multiple Bronchoalveolar lavages in three different locations, Brushings at multiple locations, and Radial EBUS performed at multiple locations. The patient required endobronchial biopsies at two discrete locations and endobronchial destruction of tumor by method other than excision at two discrete locations. The patient required ultrasound elastography evaluation of 5 discrete lymph node sites, with the images/interpretation used for intraprocedural decision-making. This resulted in >100% increased work due to increased intensity, time, technical difficulty, severity of patient's condition, and physical/mental effort required.

ATTENDING [Attending Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Linear EBUS; Radial EBUS; Ion Robotic Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Moderate

COMPLICATIONS None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL A timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location. After the successful induction of anesthesia, anesthesia placed an ETT.

Ventilation Parameters: Mode: VCV; RR: 14; TV: 450; PEEP: 12; FiO2: 70%; Flow Rate: 10; Pmean: 17.

Initial Airway Inspection The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced. Endobronchial topical lidocaine was applied to the main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.

Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal with thin bloody secretions.

Right Lung: Bloody secretions and scattered mild blood clot burden within the right-sided airways, particularly RML and RLL. Normal anatomic branching to first subsegmental level (RB7 absent, normal variant). No endobronchial tumor or active bleeding source identified.

Left Lung: Moderate blood secretions and large clot burden, including complete obstruction of LLL bronchus due to clot. Following therapeutic aspiration, endobronchial tumor was noted protruding from the LLL basilar anteromedial (LB7/8) and superior (LB6) segments, causing complete obstruction. LLL lateral (LB9) and posterior (LB10) segments appeared patent after clot removal.

Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful aspiration was performed to clean out the distal trachea, right mainstem, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, left mainstem, LUL, and LLL from mucus, blood, and blood clots.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — LUL LB1/LB2 Mass A CT-based navigation plan was loaded and partial registration was completed. The Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 0.5 cm from the planned target (Apical-Posterior Segment LUL, 7.4 cm lesion).

rEBUS: Concentric pattern with continuous margin and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.

Cone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): A low dose spin was performed; 3D reconstruction and overlay confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Sampling:

TBNA: 8 samples collected with 21G and 23G needles (Cytology, Flow, Cultures).

Cryobiopsy: 10 samples collected with 1.1 mm cryoprobe (6s freeze) (Pathology).

Brushing: 1 sample (Cytology).

Mini-BAL: 10 cc instilled, 5 cc return (Cytology).

Fiducial: One 0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold marker placed under fluoroscopy.

ROSE: TBNA showed atypical cells, large naked nuclei; cryo showed possible atypical histiocytes; not definitive for RCC.

LUL BAL: Performed at LB1/2 with 40 cc saline, 15 cc return.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RML RB4 Nodule Partial registration was repeated. The catheter was advanced to 0.5 cm from the target (Lateral Segment RML, 2.3 cm).

rEBUS: Eccentric pattern with continuous margin.

Cone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): 3D reconstruction confirmed tool-in-lesion.

Sampling:

TBNA: 7 samples collected with 21G and 23G needles (Cytology, Cultures).

Cryobiopsy: 6 samples collected with 1.1 mm cryoprobe (Pathology).

Brushing: 1 sample (Cytology).

Mini-BAL: 10 cc instilled, 5 cc return (Micro/Cultures).

Fiducial: Attempted, but marker appeared to fall out and did not enter the nodule.

ROSE: Macrophages, lymphocytes, bronchial cells.

RML BAL: Performed at RB4 with 60 cc saline, 60 cc return.

Post-biopsy fluoroscopy was negative for pneumothorax bilaterally.

EBUS Staging and Elastography The EBUS scope was introduced. All lymph node stations were assessed; only those ≥5 mm were sampled.

Station 11Ri (<10 mm): Elastography showed Type 1 (soft/benign) pattern. 4 TBNA passes performed. ROSE: Adequate, Lymphocytes, Histiocytes.

Station 11Rs (<10 mm): Elastography showed Type 2 (mixed soft/stiff) pattern. 4 TBNA passes performed. ROSE: Adequate, Lymphocytes, Histiocytes.

Station 4R (≥10 mm): Elastography showed Type 2 (mixed soft/stiff) pattern. 4 TBNA passes performed. ROSE: Adequate, many histiocytes, some lymphocytes.

Station 7 (<10 mm): Elastography showed Type 2 (mixed soft/stiff) pattern. 4 TBNA passes performed. ROSE: Adequate, Lymphocytes, Histiocytes.

Station 4L: Elastography showed Type 1 (soft/benign) pattern; decision made not to sample based on elastography and size.

Station 11L: Not assessed due to friable/bleeding endobronchial tumor in LLL.

Endobronchial Tumor Management (LLL) Endobronchial tumor within multiple LLL segmental airways was friable and bled easily.

Biopsy: Endobronchial cryobiopsy performed at LB7/8 and LB6; lesions successfully removed and sent for pathology. ROSE: Atypical cells, large naked nuclei.

Tumor Destruction (LB7/8 and LB6):

Cryotherapy: 1.1mm probe used (8-12 sec) to debulk tumor.

APC: 1.5mm probe (forcedAPC, 0.5 LPM, Effect 2) applied for coagulation/devitalization.

Results: Partial ablation achieved; hemostasis achieved (resolution of bleeding). However, airways (LB7/8 and LB6) remained 0% patent. LB9-10 airways were 100% patent after extraction of clot and nearby tumor.

Hemostasis: Nashville Grade 2 bleeding controlled with suction, cold saline, epinephrine 0.2mg, and APC.

Conclusion Residual secretions were suctioned. No active bleeding was seen. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
