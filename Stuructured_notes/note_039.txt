INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 41-year-old female who presents with endobronchial obstruction. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form or provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

PROCEDURE

31640 Bronchoscopy with excision (Tumor debulking) [Modifier -22 applied]

31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (Cryotherapy, APC, Microwave) [Modifier -22 applied]

31645 Therapeutic aspiration, initial episode

31624 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)

31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)

MODIFIER -22 DETAILS (INCREASED PROCEDURAL SERVICES) This patient required tumor debulking and relief of endobronchial obstruction via multiple modalities (mechanical debridement, cryotherapy, APC, electrocautery, and microwave ablation). This resulted in >100% increased work due to increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of the procedure, and physical/mental effort required.

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Rigid Bronchoscope; Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Electrocautery Snare; Cryoprobe; Mini Microwave Catheter; APC Probe.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimal

COMPLICATIONS None

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and laterality.

Rigid Bronchoscopy and Airway Inspection After induction of muscle relaxants, a tooth/gum protector was placed. A black rigid bronchoscope barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline, maintaining alignment with the tracheal axis and minimizing dental pressure. The vocal cords were identified, and the rigid scope was advanced carefully to the mid-trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated, and chest wall movement was confirmed.

Initial Airway Inspection Findings

Vocal Cords: Normal without mass or lesions.

Trachea: Normal.

Main Carina: Sharp.

Right Lung: Right mainstem bronchus (RMSB) completely obstructed by endobronchial mass.

Left Lung: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or other endobronchial pathology.

Mucosa: Normal in non-affected areas.

Secretions: Moderate thick and thin light yellow mucus/secretions.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, LUL Lingula Carina (LC1), and Left Carina (LC2).

Right Mainstem Bronchus Endobronchial Tumor Destruction & Excision Endobronchial obstruction was treated with multiple modalities to achieve patency.

Electrocautery/Excision: An electrocautery snare (2 cm) was utilized to ensnare the endobronchial tumor and remove the bulk of the lesion from its stalk emanating from the RUL carina (RC1).

Cryo-Extraction: Once removed from its stalk, a 2.4 mm cryoprobe was used to freeze and grasp the endobronchial mass, removing it en bloc with the flexible bronchoscope through the rigid barrel.

Microwave Ablation: A mini microwave catheter was used to treat the residual tumor. Two applications were administered (1 kJ at 62°C for 1 min 20 sec; 2.5 kJ at 80°C for 3 min).

Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC): A 1.5 mm Straightfire probe was used (Forced, Flow 0.5 LPM, 40W) for hemostasis and further destruction.

Treatment Summary

Electrocautery: 2cm Snare (EndoCut Q); 3-5 second applications. Result: Good tumor destruction/debulking.

APC: 1.5mm Straightfire probe (40W); 2-3 second applications. Result: Good tumor destruction/debulking.

Microwave: Mini antenna; 2 applications. Result: Good tumor destruction/debulking.

Cryoprobe: 2.4mm probe; 15-30 second freezes. Result: Good tumor destruction/debulking.

Airway Patency Results

Pre-treatment: Right Mainstem airway was noted to be 1% patent.

Post-treatment: The airway was 100% patent.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed in the Superior Segment (LB4) and Inferior Segment (LB5) of the Lingula. 60 cc of normal saline was instilled, and 20 cc was returned. Specimens were submitted for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

SPECIMENS

Right mainstem endobronchial tumor (Pathology)

LUL Lingula BAL (Cell count, Cytology, Microbiology)

IMPRESSION / PLAN

41-year-old female presenting for evaluation and management of right mainstem endobronchial tumor.

Tumor was successfully debulked using a combination of mechanical debridement, cryotherapy, APC, electrocautery, and microwave ablation.

Total patency was restored to the right mainstem bronchus at the conclusion of the procedure.

Await final pathology and BAL results.

Post-procedure Chest X-Ray.

Recommend treatment for post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA) if not already initiated.

Repeat bronchoscopy with Interventional Pulmonology in 4 weeks.
