PROCEDURE IN DETAIL

Chest Ultrasound Bedside ultrasound was performed on the right hemithorax.


Pleural Effusion: Large volume, anechoic echogenicity.


Loculations: None.


Diaphragmatic Motion: Normal.


Lung: Sliding was present before and after the procedure. Lung consolidation/atelectasis was present.


Pleura: Normal.

Images were saved and uploaded to the media tab.

Catheter Placement The insertion site at the right 7th intercostal space, mid-axillary line, was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered.

A 14Fr pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique.

Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid.

A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction, and the introducer needle was removed.

A dilator was inserted over the wire with a twisting motion to form a tract for catheter insertion.

The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire.

The catheter was inserted until all catheter holes were well within the chest.

The guidewire and trochar were removed.

Drainage and Securement The tube was attached to a Pleurovac collection drain apparatus.


Fluid Removed: 1225 ml of serous fluid.


Suction: Applied at -20 cmH2O.


Securement: The catheter was sutured in place and covered.

SPECIMENS None
