PROCEDURE IN DETAIL

Chest Ultrasound (CPT 76604) Focused thoracic ultrasound was performed and images were saved and printed.


Hemithorax: Left 


Pleural Effusion: Large volume, anechoic echogenicity with thin loculations.


Diaphragmatic Motion: Diminished.


Lung Sliding: Present before procedure.


Pleura: Normal.

Based on ultrasound evaluation, thoracentesis was determined to be feasible and proceeded as planned.

Thoracentesis (CPT 32555) The patient was positioned sitting. The insertion site was identified at the left 6th intercostal space along the mid-scapular line. The site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.

Local anesthesia was achieved using 10 ml of Lidocaine 1%. A thoracentesis kit was used. A needle was inserted into the pleural space and fluid was aspirated.

Procedure Findings:


Fluid Removed: 150 ml 


Appearance: Serosanguinous 


Drainage Device: Drainage Bag 


Suction: None 

Lung sliding was confirmed present post-procedure. No lung consolidation or atelectasis was noted. The site was not sutured.

SPECIMENS The following studies were ordered on the pleural fluid:

LDH, Glucose, Total Protein, Cholesterol 

Cell Count 

Gram Stain/Culture, AFB, Fungal Culture 

Cytology
