ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope, Linear EBUS, Radial EBUS, Ion Robotic Bronchoscope, Cios Spin system.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and location.

Airway Inspection and Preparation Therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem of mucus. A CT chest scan was loaded onto the planning station to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway, which was verified and loaded into the robotic platform.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — LUL Nodule


Target: Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3); lesion approximately 2 cm.


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was engaged and advanced to 1.0 cm from the planned target under navigational guidance.


rEBUS: Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric location with a continuous margin and absence of a linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Cone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): A low-dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. The 3D reconstructions were interpreted on the Ion workstation, and the robotic system was adjusted to the newly acquired nodule location.

Sampling:

TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration with 21G needle; 4 samples collected.

Biopsy: Transbronchial biopsy with alligator forceps; 1 sample collected.

Cryobiopsy: Transbronchial cryobiopsy performed with 1.1mm probe (6-second freeze); 6 samples collected. Note: This required substantially greater work due to technical difficulty.

Brushing: Transbronchial brushing performed; 1 sample collected.


BAL: Lavage performed with 10 cc NS instilled, 5 cc return.


Fiducial Placement: A 0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold marker was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopic guidance.


ROSE: Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RLL Nodule (Attempted)


Target: Lateral-basal Segment of RLL (RB9); lesion approximately 1 cm.


Navigation: Catheter advanced to 1.0 cm from target.


rEBUS: Nodule not visible.


Cone-Beam CT: Two spins were performed to assess the area, but the RLL nodule was not identified on the system.


Outcome: Procedure aborted for this target due to inability to identify the nodule.

EBUS STAGING Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed for diagnostic and staging purposes. All lymph node stations were assessed, and those ≥5 mm were considered for sampling. Elastography was used to assess stiffness (Types 1-3).

Station 11Rs (<10 mm):

Elastography: Type 1 (predominantly soft/benign).

Sampling: 4 biopsies performed (TBNA) despite benign appearance to confirm absence of malignancy.

Station 7 (≥10 mm):

Elastography: Type 2 (mixed soft/stiff).

Sampling: 4 biopsies performed (TBNA) directed at representative areas.

Station 11L (<10 mm):

Elastography: Type 2 (mixed soft/stiff).

Sampling: 4 biopsies performed (TBNA) directed at representative areas.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.

IMPRESSION / PLAN

77-year-old female with lung nodule.

Successful sampling of LUL nodule (LB3) with ROSE showing conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.
