INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 22-year-old female who presents with airway stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified 

Airway stenosis (distal left mainstem bronchus) 

Airway malacia (left mainstem bronchus) 

PROCEDURE

Therapeutic aspiration, subsequent episodes (CPT 31646) 

Diagnostic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (CPT 31624) 

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Disposable Bronchoscope 

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Airway Inspection


Patient Position/Airway: The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was noted to be in good position.


Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.


Larynx: Normal.


Vocal Cords: Normal without mass or lesions.


Trachea: Mildly tortuous. Secretions were minimal, thin, and clear.


Carina: Sharp.

Right Lung


Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to the segmental level.


Findings: No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or other endobronchial pathology.

Left Lung


Proximal Airways: The distal left mainstem bronchus (LMSB) was noted to be slightly stenotic (~8mm).


Malacia: On PEEP 0, the airways were noted to have slight malacia (<50%) at the proximal and distal left mainstem bronchus.


Distal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to the segmental level in the LLL was observed, noting historic obliteration of the LUL.


Findings: No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or other endobronchial pathology. Mucosa was normal.

Therapeutic Interventions


Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2).


Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): BAL was performed at the Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal Segment of LLL (LB9), and Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10).


Technique: Instilled 60 cc of NS; suction returned with 20 cc of NS.


Disposition: Samples were sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).

Termination The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

SPECIMEN(S)

LLL BAL (cell count, microbiology) 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

22-year-old female presenting for evaluation of airway stenosis.


Findings: Distal left mainstem stenosis (~8mm) and mild left mainstem malacia (<50%) identified. LUL obliteration noted.

Plan:

Follow up on BAL results.

Repeat bronchoscopy in 4 weeks for possible dilation and stenting.
