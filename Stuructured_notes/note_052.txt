INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORTINDICATION FOR OPERATION
[REDACTED] is a 82-year-old female who presents with lymphadenopathy. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSISR59.0 Localized enlarged lymph nodes POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSISR59.0 Localized enlarged lymph nodes PROCEDURE31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 31653 EBUS sampling 3 or more nodes 76982 Ultrasound Elastography, First Target Lesion 76983 Ultrasound Elastography, Additional Targets (x2) ANESTHESIA
General Anesthesia MONITORING
Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.INSTRUMENTATION
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Linear EBUS.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS
None COMPLICATIONS
None PROCEDURE IN DETAILAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).Initial Airway Inspection & Therapeutic Aspiration
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.EBUS Staging
Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed. All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling was performed using 25-gauge and 22-gauge needles.Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. Elastography provided a semi-quantitative classification (Type 1–3), which was used to guide biopsy site selection and sampling strategy.Lymph Nodes Evaluated:Station 11L (Site 1):Appearance: The lymph node was $\ge$ 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan.Elastography: The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions.Sampling: Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas. The site was sampled with 4 endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsies.ROSE: Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of anthracotic pigments.Station 4R (Site 2, Lower Paratracheal):Appearance: The lymph node was $\ge$ 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan.Elastography: The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions.Sampling: Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas. The site was sampled with 4 endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsies.ROSE: Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of anthracotic pigments.Station 11Rs (Site 3):Appearance: The lymph node was $\ge$ 10 mm on CT and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan.Elastography: The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions.Sampling: Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas. The site was sampled with 4 endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsies.ROSE: Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of anthracotic pigments.Conclusion
The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.SPECIMENS11L TBNA 11Rs TBNA 4R TBNA IMPRESSION / PLAN82-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for lymphadenopathy.Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Suggestive of benign-appearing lymphoid tissue.Preliminary cytology for stations 11L, 4R, and 11Rs suggestive of anthracotic pigments; final results pending.Follow-up final pathology.Follow-up in clinic.
