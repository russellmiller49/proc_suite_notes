INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Current Date] ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: [Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 49-year-old female with polycythemia vera (JAK2 mutation) and a history of thrombogenic events. She presented with shortness of breath and chest pain and was found to have group 4 CTEPH with massive PEs and RV strain. Her course was complicated by a left CVA following failed thrombectomy and subsequent RV failure requiring VA ECMO, which was converted to VV ECMO on 12/10. The patient requires a tracheostomy to assist with ventilator weaning, secretion management, and rehabilitation.

CONSENT The primary team, ICU team, and family were in agreement with the procedure. The nature, purpose, risks, and benefits were discussed. Consent was signed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Respiratory failure on VV ECMO 

CTEPH, Acute PE, RV Failure 

Left MCA CVA with right hemiplegia

Bronchoscopic guidance 

ANESTHESIA Local anesthesia with sedation/analgesia as per ICU protocol.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS 1 mL 

COMPLICATIONS None immediately apparent 

DISPOSITION Stable, ventilated, remained in ICU, on VV ECMO 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL

Preparation and Exposure The patient remained in the ICU on VV ECMO support. She was positioned supine with a padded shoulder roll, head elevated, and neck moderately extended. A surgical timeout was performed. The anterior neck was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.

Neck ultrasound was performed to confirm vascular anatomy. A slightly high-riding innominate artery and a large bridging neck vein were identified. 5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected 2-3 cm above the sternal notch; the injection site was adjusted higher due to the known partially high-riding innominate artery.

Incision and Dissection A 3 cm horizontal skin incision was made with a #15 blade in a relaxed skin tension line midway between the cricoid cartilage and the sternal notch. Bovie cautery was used to dissect through the platysma down to the strap muscles, avoiding the anterior jugular veins. Two vertical engorged veins were identified with a bridging vein between them. The bridging vein was dissected, suture ligated, and divided to allow visualization of the midline raphe.

The strap muscles were separated vertically at the midline with Bovie cautery and retracted laterally. Using blunt and careful cautery dissection, the anterior tracheal wall was freed of soft tissue. The innominate artery was identified and protected; the soft tissue between the artery and trachea was left undisturbed.

Tracheostomy Placement The trachea was palpated to identify the 2nd and 3rd tracheal rings, ensuring adequate distance from the innominate artery. Under bronchoscopic guidance, the endotracheal tube cuff was deflated and withdrawn to a level below the vocal cords. A finder needle was placed through the anterior trachea between the 2nd and 3rd cartilaginous rings.

Once position was confirmed by bronchoscopy, a Seldinger technique was used to serially dilate the tract over a wire. A #7 cuffed Shiley tracheostomy tube was placed.

Confirmation and Closure The tracheostomy cuff was inflated. Cross-table ventilation was performed, and placement was confirmed by both bronchoscopic visualization through the tracheostomy and CO2 return on the monitor. The inner cannula was inserted.

Surgicel was placed in the wound bed for hemostasis, anticipating the resumption of anticoagulation. The tracheostomy was secured with loose 2-0 prolene sutures to the skin and tracheostomy straps. The endotracheal tube was withdrawn completely.

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Successful placement of #7 Shiley tracheostomy via modified open/percutaneous technique.

Okay to resume bivalirudin (anticoagulation) in 1 hour.

Trach ties to remain for 7-10 days.

No routine trach exchange within the first 14 days unless issues arise.

Avoid over-inflation of the cuff.

Husband notified of successful procedure.
