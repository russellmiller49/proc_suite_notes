INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: February 9, 2026 INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 49-year-old female who presents with respiratory failure. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery, and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT: Obtained before the procedure. Its indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.


PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: * J96.90 Respiratory Failure 


POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: * J96.90 Respiratory Failure 

Stoma erosion noted at the 4 o'clock (inferolateral) position 


PROCEDURE: * 31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 

31624 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 

31502-22 Tracheotomy tube change prior to establishment of fistula tract 


Modifier 22 Note: Substantially greater work than normal (>50% increased work) due to the requirement of wound packing at the tracheostomy stoma.


ATTENDING: [Name] ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation (99152, 99153) administered by ICU RN.


Medications: Versed 5 mg, Fentanyl 150 mcg, Propofol gtt 60 mcg/kg/min.


Total Sedation Time: 92 minutes (Start: 1338, Stop: 1510).


MONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the entire procedure. The patient was monitored one-to-one by the attending physician during anesthesia.


INSTRUMENT: Flexible Diagnostic Bronchoscope 


ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None 


COMPLICATIONS: None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and procedure.


Patient Position: Supine 

Initial Airway Inspection:


Tracheostomy tube: In good position.


Pharynx/Larynx/Trachea: Normal.


Vocal Cords: Normal without mass or lesions.


Main Carina: Sharp.


Bronchial Tree: Normal anatomic branching to the segmental level bilaterally; no evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or endobronchial pathology.


Mucosa/Secretions: Normal mucosa; minimal, thin, clear secretions.

Therapeutic Aspiration and Lavage: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the subglottic area, trachea, bilaterally mainstems, and segmental carinas (RC1, RC2, Lc1, LC2). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the lateral (RB4) and medial (RB5) segments of the RML. 40 cc of NS was instilled with a return of 15 cc.

Tracheostomy Tube Change: The upper airway and endotracheal space were suctioned. The cuff was deflated and the existing Shiley cuffed size 7.0 mm tube was removed. The stoma appeared widely patent; however, an erosion was visualized at the 4 o'clock (inferolateral) position.

Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr. Hudson) was consulted. Under their guidance, the erosion was packed with iodoform gauze. A new Portex cuffed size 7.0 mm tracheostomy tube was placed with an obturator, which was then replaced with an inner cannula and the cuff inflated.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition at the conclusion.


SPECIMENS: * RML BAL (Cell count, microbiology, cytology) 


IMPRESSION / PLAN: * Successful tracheostomy tube exchange (Shiley to Portex 7.0 mm) and diagnostic bronchoscopy.

RML BAL performed; results pending.

Stoma erosion identified and packed with iodoform gauze.


Plan: Recommend Wound Care evaluation for stoma erosion; follow up BAL results; continue care per primary team.
