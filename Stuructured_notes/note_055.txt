ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Linear EBUS; Radial EBUS; Ion Robotic Bronchoscope; Cios Spin system; Cryobiopsy probe.

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RLL Target A CT-based navigation plan was loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform and partial registration was completed.


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of the RLL (RB6). The target lesion measured approximately 0.5 cm in diameter. Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm from the planned target.


rEBUS: Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric nodule location with continuous margins and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Imaging Verification: Cone Beam CT (Cios Spin) was performed with 3D reconstruction on an independent workstation. The images were interpreted, and the Ion system was adjusted to the newly acquired nodule location.

Sampling:


TBNA: 21G needle, 4 samples collected.


Cryobiopsy: 1.1mm cryoprobe, 6-second freeze time, 6 samples collected.


Brushing: Protected cytology brush, 1 sample collected.


BAL: 10 cc NS instilled, 5 cc returned.


Fiducial Placement: A 0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold marker was placed under fluoroscopy guidance.


ROSE: Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — LLL Target


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Posterior-Basal Segment of the LLL (LB10). The target lesion measured approximately 0.5 cm in diameter. The catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm from the target.


rEBUS: Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric nodule location with continuous margins.

Imaging Verification: Cone Beam CT (Cios Spin) was performed; 3D reconstruction confirmed nodule location and the system was adjusted accordingly.

Sampling:


TBNA: 21G needle, 6 samples collected.


Cryobiopsy: 1.1mm cryoprobe, 6-second freeze time, 6 samples collected.


Brushing: Protected cytology brush, 1 sample collected.


BAL: 10 cc NS instilled, 5 cc returned.


Fiducial Placement: A 0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold marker was placed under fluoroscopy guidance.


ROSE: Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.

Inspection prior to bronchoscope withdrawal demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.

EBUS Staging The linear EBUS scope was introduced. All lymph node stations were assessed; only those 5 mm or greater were sampled.


Station 7 (Subcarinal): Node measured => 10 mm on CT. Elastography demonstrated a Type 2 pattern (mixed soft and stiff regions).


Sampling: TBNA was performed with 4 passes.

Final airway inspection demonstrated no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
