ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Linear EBUS; Radial EBUS; Ion Robotic Bronchoscope; Cios Spin System.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and procedure location. Patient position: [Supine]. Initial airway inspection: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus. A CT-based navigation plan was loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Target 1: Lingular Nodule Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Superior Segment of the Lingula (LB4).

Target: Lesion is approximately 1 cm in diameter. Catheter advanced to 1.0 cm from target under navigational guidance.


rEBUS: Radial EBUS confirmed an Eccentric signal. Features noted: Continuous margin and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.

Cone-beam CT (Cios Spin): A low-dose spin was performed. 3D reconstructions on an independent workstation were interpreted by the attending.


Adjustment: The system was updated with the acquired nodule location and the robotic catheter was adjusted to the new target.

Sampling:

TBNA: 21G needle; 4 samples collected.

Transbronchial Biopsy: Alligator forceps; 1 sample collected.

Cryobiopsy: 1.1mm cryoprobe, 6-second freeze time; 6 samples collected.

Brushing: Protected cytology brush; 1 sample collected.


BAL: 20 cc NS instilled, 10 cc returned.


Fiducial: One 0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold marker was placed under fluoroscopy guidance.


ROSE: Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm. No bleeding was noted prior to withdrawal.

Target 2: LUL Anterior Nodule Robotic navigation was performed to the Anterior Segment of LUL (LB3).

Target: Lesion is approximately 1 cm in diameter. Catheter advanced to 1.0 cm from target.


rEBUS: Radial EBUS confirmed an Eccentric signal. Features noted: Continuous margin and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Cone-beam CT (Cios Spin): Spin performed, 3D images interpreted, and catheter position adjusted/confirmed.

Sampling:

TBNA: 21G needle; 6 samples collected.


Cryobiopsy: Attempted but technically challenging; unable to penetrate airway wall for consistent biopsy.


BAL: 60 cc NS instilled, 15 cc returned.


ROSE: Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.


Hemostasis: 200mg of Tranexamic Acid (TXA) was placed in the LUL to achieve hemostasis. No evidence of bleeding upon inspection.

EBUS STAGING The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced. All lymph node stations were assessed. Technique: Only nodes ≥5 mm in short axis were considered for sampling. EBUS elastography was performed to assess tissue stiffness (Type 1-3).


Stations Inspected: 4R, 4L, 7, 10R, 10L, 11Rs, 11Ri, 11L.

Site 1 - Station 4L: <10 mm on CT, Non-Hypermetabolic on PET. Elastography Type 1 (soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).

Site 2 - Station 7: <10 mm on CT, Non-Hypermetabolic on PET. Elastography Type 1 (soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).


Other Stations: No detectable lymph nodes noted in other stations.

No immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.

SPECIMENS

Lingula nodule: TBNA (4 samples), TBBX (1 sample), Cryobiopsy (6 samples), Brush (1 sample) — Pathology/Cytology.

Lingula nodule: BAL — Microbiology.

IMPRESSION / PLAN

88-year-old female with bilateral lung nodules successfully sampled via Robotic Bronchoscopy.

Lingula Nodule: ROSE conclusive for malignant neoplasm. Fiducial marker placed.

LUL Anterior Nodule: ROSE conclusive for malignant neoplasm.

EBUS Staging: Complete inspection performed; no nodes met criteria for sampling (benign elastography/size/PET features).

Follow-up in clinic for final pathology results.
