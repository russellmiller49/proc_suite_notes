DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name / Self, Referred]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 32-year-old male who presents with lung infiltrates and possible sarcoid. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.


Patient Position: [Supine].

Initial Airway Inspection: NBI was used to assess the airway and nodular changes were noted.

Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5). Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Endobronchial Biopsy: Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), and LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1). Lesions were successfully removed and samples sent for Pathology.

Radial EBUS & Transbronchial Biopsy: Radial EBUS was performed to confirm that the location of the lesion in the LLL is concentric. The following features were noted: Continuous margin; no vessels were noted. Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps at the Posterior-Basal Segment of LLL (LB10). Total 6 samples were collected and sent for Pathology.

EBUS STAGING Indications: Diagnostic


Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 22-gauge Needle, 19-gauge Needle, and Cryoprobe 1.1mm.


Lymph Nodes Inspected: 4R, 4L, 7, 10R, 10L, 11Rs, 11Ri, 11L.

Lymph Nodes Evaluated & Sampled:


Station 7 (Subcarinal): The node was ≥ 10 mm on CT. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics. The target lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft and stiff regions. Given this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas. The lymph node was photographed and the site was sampled; 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained.


Station 11Rs: The lymph node was < 10 mm on CT. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed; the node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. The site was not sampled as it was not clinically indicated.


Station 11L: The lymph node was < 10 mm on CT. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed; the node demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process. The site was not sampled as it was not clinically indicated.

Conclusion: The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
