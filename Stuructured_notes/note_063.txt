DATE OF PROCEDURE: February 9, 2026 INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 68-year-old male who presents with airway stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. Consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

Foreign body removal (Stent removal) (31635) 

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Rigid Bronchoscope; Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; APC (Straightfire probe); Pulmonary forceps; Elation balloons (8/9/10 and 10/11/12).

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection (via LMA) The laryngeal mask airway was in good position.

Larynx/Trachea: Normal. Vocal cords normal without mass/lesions. Trachea normal.


Main Carina: Somewhat splayed with granulation tissue noted.


Right Lung: Stenosis noted at the anastomosis/suture line with granulation tissue at the RMSB.


Left Lung: Proximal stenosis noted at the Left Mainstem Bronchus (LMSB). The existing metallic stent in the LMSB had migrated distally, leaving a stenotic and highly malacic ~1cm section proximal to the stent. Thick tenacious mucus was noted within the stent.

Therapeutic Interventions


Therapeutic Aspiration: Performed to clear mucus from the Trachea, Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina, RML Carina, LUL Lingula Carina, and Left Carina.


Biopsy & Tissue Removal: Endobronchial biopsy was performed at the LMSB; the lesion was successfully removed.

Stenosis/Granulation Treatment: Granulation tissue causing stenosis at the proximal LMSB was treated. Mechanical destruction was performed using pulmonary forceps, followed by APC ablation (Straightfire probe, Forced coag, Effect 2) for destruction and hemostasis.


Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Performed at the Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8) with 60 cc NS instilled and 20 cc return.

Rigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Exchange The LMA was removed, and a rigid bronchoscope was introduced. The vocal cords were identified, and the scope was advanced to the distal trachea; jet ventilation was initiated.


Stent Removal: The patient's existing MicroTech 10mm x 40mm stent was grasped with pulmonary forceps and removed en bloc.


Balloon Dilation (LMSB): A 10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to dilate the LMSB to 12 mm (1 inflation, 60 seconds).


Stent Placement: A new Bonastent (10mm x 50mm) was placed in the Left Mainstem bronchus.


Post-Deployment Dilation: The stent was dilated to 12 mm using a 10/11/12 Elation balloon to expand and seat the stent (4 inflations, 30 seconds each).

Additional Balloon Dilations


Left Lower Lobe: Dilated to 12 mm using 10/11/12 Elation balloon (1 inflation, 30 seconds).


Left Upper Lobe: Dilated to 10 mm using 10/11/12 Elation balloon (1 inflation, 30 seconds).


Right Mainstem: Dilated to 10 mm using 8/9/10 Elation balloon (1 inflation, 60 seconds).

The rigid bronchoscope was extubated, the LMA replaced, and lidocaine applied to the vocal cords. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.

IMPRESSION/PLAN

68-year-old male with airway stenosis and distal migration of existing stent.

Existing stent removed; Bonastent 10mm x 50mm re-placed in the LMSB.

Multilevel balloon dilation performed (LMSB, LUL, LLL, RMSB) and granulation tissue ablated.

Follow-up BAL and pathology results.

Continue stent hydration therapy regimen.

Repeat bronchoscopy in approximately 4 weeks for re-evaluation.
