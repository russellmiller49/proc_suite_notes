INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 84-year-old female who presents with a lung mass.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure.

The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.

Positive for malignancy on ROSE (Station 4R).

PROCEDURE

Therapeutic aspiration (initial episode).

Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) lymph node sampling (1 or 2 nodes).

Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).

Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE).

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia.

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Linear EBUS; Disposable Bronchoscope; 25-gauge and 22-gauge TBNA needles.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None.

COMPLICATIONS None.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection & Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

EBUS Staging Indications: Diagnostic. All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 22-gauge Needle.

Lymph Nodes Evaluated:


Station 11Rs: The lymph node was ≥ 10 mm on CT (Metabolic activity unknown). The lymph node was photographed and sampled. 6 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed.


ROSE Results: Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as not adequate and suggestive of blood and bronchial cells. Final results are pending.


Station 4R (lower paratracheal): The lymph node was ≥ 10 mm on CT (Metabolic activity unknown). The lymph node was photographed and sampled. 8 endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed.


ROSE Results: Preliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of Positive for malignancy. Final results are pending.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
