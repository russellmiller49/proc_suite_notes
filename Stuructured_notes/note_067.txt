INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 63-year-old female who presents with a pulmonary nodule. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

R91.1 Solitary Lung Nodule 

PROCEDURE

Robotic navigational bronchoscopy (Ion) 

Radial EBUS localization 

Cone-beam CT guidance (Cios Spin) with 3D rendering and interpretation 

Therapeutic aspiration (airway clearance) 

TBNA of RUL mass (19G needle) 

Transbronchial microwave ablation of RUL mass 

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope, Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope, Radial EBUS, Ion Robotic Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection & Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Bronchus Intermedius from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RUL Mass A CT Chest scan was placed on a separate planning station to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.

Ventilation Parameters: Mode: VCV | RR: 12 | TV: 300 | PEEP: 12 | FiO2: 100% | Flow Rate: 10 | Pmean: 15.

Navigation and Localization Robotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration.


Targeting: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of the RUL (RB3). The target lesion is about 4.0 cm in diameter.


Alignment: Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target. The needle was advanced into the lesion.


Imaging & Adjustment: Cone Beam CT (Cios Spin) was performed with 3D reconstructions on an independent workstation. The images were interpreted, and the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the newly acquired nodule location.

Target Sampling (RUL Mass)


TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 19G needle through the extended working channel. Total 1 sample was collected and sent for cytology.


rEBUS Confirmation: Radial EBUS confirmed the nodule location was Concentric after initial puncture. Features noted: continuous margin, heterogenous echotexture.

Transbronchial Microwave Ablation Once a tunnel had been created into the lesion with TBNA, transbronchial microwave ablation was performed.


Ablation 1: Medium Antenna at 90°C for 20:00 min.


Ablation 2 (RB2): RB2 was engaged, and the microwave catheter was placed in the lateral superior aspect of the lung mass. CBCT confirmed location.

Settings: Medium Antenna at 90°C for 10:00 min.


Ablation 3 (RB1): RB1 was engaged, and the microwave catheter was placed in the superior medial aspect of the lung mass. CBCT confirmed location.

Settings: Medium Antenna at 90°C for 10:00 min.

Final Confirmation Cone Beam CT (Cios Spin) was performed again for evaluation. 3D reconstructions confirmed tool-in-lesion.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
