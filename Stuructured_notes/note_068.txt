Endobronchial Obstruction / APC Ablation Endobronchial obstruction at the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, and Left Mainstem was treated with the following modalities:

Modality: APC

Tool: 2.3 mm straight probe

Setting: Pulse effect 4

SPECIMEN(S) None 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

[REDACTED] is a 65-year-old male who presented for stent evaluation; RML stent noted in good position.

Mucus successfully aspirated from RMS, Bronchus Intermedius, and LMS.

Obstruction in Trachea, RMS, and LMS treated with APC; patency improved from 90% to 100%.

Repeat bronchoscopy in 4-6 weeks.
