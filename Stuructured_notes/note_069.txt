MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimal 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). Sedation was initiated and an LMA was placed.

Initial Airway Inspection The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination. Endobronchial topical lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords, main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.


Larynx/Vocal Cords: No lesions; normal movement without mass.


Trachea/Bronchi: Extensive partially obstructing vascular endobronchial tumor and overlying white necrotic debris were noted involving the mid-trachea, distal trachea, main carina, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe bronchus, right lower lobe bronchus, and left mainstem bronchus.


Severity: Obstruction was most severe at the distal trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and bronchus intermedius.


Right Middle Lobe (RML): Highly stenotic and completely obstructed by tumor, debris, and mucus; unable to traverse initially.


Right Lower Lobe (RLL): Moderate stenosis of RB6 and truncus basalis due to tumor and extrinsic compression.

Therapeutic Interventions


Therapeutic Aspiration: Secretions were moderate, thin, and clear. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus and overlying necrotic debris from the trachea, right mainstem, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, left mainstem, LUL, and LLL.


Endobronchial Biopsy: Biopsies were performed at tumor sites in the trachea, main carina, right mainstem, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, and left mainstem. These were combined into a single sample labeled "trachea".


Tumor Excision: The obstructing tumor at the trachea, main carina, right mainstem, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, and left mainstem was excised with mechanical debridement using bland alligator forceps.


Tumor Ablation (APC): Tumor destruction was performed using a 1.5mm Pulmonary axial 'straight-fire' probe (forcedAPC, 0.5 LPM, Max Watts 30-40) in 1-5 second bursts. Extensive tumor ablation and hemostasis were achieved across the trachea, main carina, right-sided airways, and left mainstem.

Right Middle Lobe Management After tumor excision and ablation, the RML bronchus was traversed with a Hybrid bronchoscope and saline hydrodissection. Patency of RB4 (lateral) was confirmed; RB5 (medial) appeared viable but filled with debris.


Balloon Dilation: A 6/7/8 mm Elation balloon was used to dilate the RML stenosis to 7 mm (2 inflations, 60 and 30 seconds). The therapeutic scope could then traverse with moderate pressure.


Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Performed at the RML (RB4 and RB5) with 60 cc instilled and 15 cc returned.


Stent Placement: An AEROMini 6x15mm stent was placed in the RML bronchus. It seated very well and maintained patency of both RB4 and RB5 segments.

Right Lower Lobe Management


Balloon Dilation: A 6/7/8 mm Elation balloon was used to dilate the RLL bronchus take-off to 8 mm (1 inflation, 60 seconds).

Results and Patency


Trachea: Improved from 80% patent to 95% patent.


Right-sided airways (excl. RML): Improved from 60% patent to 90% patent.


RML Bronchus: Improved from 1% patent to 80% patent.


Left Mainstem: Improved from 80% patent to 95% patent.

Residual secretions, saline, and blood were suctioned to clear. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The LMA was removed in the operating room.

SPECIMENS

Endobronchial biopsy (combined samples from trachea, carina, right airways, and left mainstem): Pathology 

RML BAL: Cell count, micro/cultures, cytology 

IMPRESSION/PLAN [REDACTED] is a 64-year-old male who underwent bronchoscopy for endobronchial tumor excision/ablation, airway dilation, and RML stent placement.


Intervention: Extensive endobronchial tumor excision and ablation in the trachea, main carina, right mainstem, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, and left mainstem.


Stent: Placement of AEROMini 6x15mm stent in RML bronchus.

Post-Procedure Care:

Follow-up post-op CXR.

Await EBBx and BAL results.

Stent hydration/hygiene protocol: QID albuterol nebulizer, hypertonic saline (3%, 4mL) nebulizer, and flutter valve regimen; Mucinex 1200mg BID for mucolysis. Engage case management to obtain devices/meds prior to discharge.


Follow-up: Repeat bronchoscopy with airway evaluation, stent check, and likely additional tumor excision/ablation in ~3-4 weeks. Consideration of rigid bronchoscopy with micro-debrider given extensive involvement.
