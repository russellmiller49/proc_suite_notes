COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection & Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RUL Nodule A CT scan was used to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway, which was verified and loaded into the robotic platform. Robotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration. The robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of the RUL (RB3). The target lesion measured approximately 1 cm in diameter.

Balloon Dilation Significant difficulties were encountered during navigation due to a small carina. A 5mm x 20mm Mustang balloon was used to dilate the distal airway under direct fluoro-guidance using Omnipaque 240 as the inflation agent. Following dilation, the robotic bronchoscope was successfully navigated to the distal nodule.

Target Localization & Confirmation


Navigation: The Ion catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.


Radial EBUS: Performed to confirm location; the nodule appeared Eccentric with a continuous margin.


Cone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): A low-dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. 3D reconstructions were interpreted on an independent workstation and passed to the Ion platform.


Adjustment: Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.

RUL Target Sampling


TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 21G needle; total 6 samples collected for Cytology.


Forceps Biopsy: Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps; total 2 samples collected for Pathology.


Cryobiopsy: Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with a 1.1mm cryoprobe (6-second freeze time); total 6 samples collected for Pathology. Note: This patient required Transbronchial Cryobiopsies, resulting in >40% increased work due to technical difficulty and physical/mental effort required.

Brushing: Transbronchial brushing performed with a protected cytology brush; 1 sample collected for Microbiology.


BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage performed with 40 cc NS instilled and 15 cc returned; sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.


Fiducial Placement: A fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance prior to withdrawal.

ROSE (Ion Procedure) Conclusive evidence of malignant neoplasm.

EBUS STAGING


Indications: Diagnostic and Staging. Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and elastography was used to assess stiffness.

Lymph Nodes Evaluated:

Station 11L: < 10 mm. Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).

Station 7 (Subcarinal): ≥ 10 mm. Type 2 elastographic pattern (mixed soft and stiff regions). Sampled. TBNA was directed at representative areas; 4 biopsies were performed.

Station 4R (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm. Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).

Station 11Rs: < 10 mm. Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).


Also Inspected: 4L (lower paratracheal).

COMPLICATIONS There were no immediate complications.
