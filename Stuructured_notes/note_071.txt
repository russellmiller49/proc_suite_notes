PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection Findings: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus. Stents are in good position. The (iCAST 7x16) was noted in the right lower airway. (iCAST 5x16) was noted in the right middle lobe airway.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage: Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at RLL. Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS. Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).

Endobronchial Biopsy: Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Bronchus Intermedius. Two areas were biopsied with NBI guidance. Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal) and Pathology.

Balloon Dilation: Balloon dilation was performed at RB2 orifice. 5mm mustang balloon was used to perform dilation to 5mm at the RB2. Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
