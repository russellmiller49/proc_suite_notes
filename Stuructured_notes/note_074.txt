PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). Patient Position: [Supine] 

Initial Airway Inspection Findings: Rigid Black ventilating scope was used to intubate the patient. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Endobronchial Tumor Destruction Endobronchial obstruction at the Left Mainstem (100% obstruction) was treated with the following modalities:


Electrocautery: Knife (PreciSect) for 10 seconds; removed.


Microwave: Mini probe (90°C) for 2 min and 1.5 min; ablated.

Prior to treatment, affected airway was noted to be 0% patent. After treatment, the airway was 100% patent.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LLL and LUL subsegments from mucus.

Airway Stent Placement The following stent (Bonastent 10x20) was placed in the LLL basal subsegment to the LC2. The stent was placed jailing LB6 (origin of the tumor).

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the Superior Segment of Lingula (LB4) and Inferior Segment of Lingula (LB5). Instilled 20 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS. Samples sent for Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
