ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Linear EBUS; Radial EBUS; Ion Robotic Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location. Patient Position: [Supine] Initial Airway Inspection: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) A CT chest scan was used on a separate planning station to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.


Registration: Robotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration.


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anterior Segment of the RUL (RB3). Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.


rEBUS Verification: Radial EBUS was performed to confirm the location of the nodule (approx. 1 cm in diameter). The nodule location was confirmed as Eccentric with a continuous margin.


Cone Beam CT (Cios Spin): The Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of nodule location. A low dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. 3D reconstructions were performed on an independent workstation and interpreted personally by the attending.


Adjustment: The images were passed to the Ion platform; using the newly acquired nodule location, the robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.

Target Sampling (RUL Anterior Segment/RB3)

TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 21G needle through the extended working channel. Total 6 samples were collected.

TBBX: Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps. Total 6 samples were collected.

Brushing: Transbronchial brushing was performed with a protected cytology brush. Total 1 sample was collected.

BAL: Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed. Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.


Fiducial Placement: A fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance.

Inspection prior to withdrawal demonstrated no evidence of bleeding.

EBUS STAGING


Indications: Diagnostic and Staging. Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed. Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled. Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling was performed using a 22-gauge needle. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was performed to assess lymph node stiffness.

Lymph Nodes Evaluated:

Station 11L: < 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled as it was not clinically indicated.

Station 7 (Subcarinal): ≥ 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Despite benign appearance, TBNA was performed to confirm absence of malignancy. 4 samples were obtained.

Station 4L (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern. Not sampled.

Station 4R (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern. Not sampled.

Station 11Rs: < 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated a Type 1 elastographic pattern. Not sampled.

There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
