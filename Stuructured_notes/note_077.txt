EBUS sampling 3 or more nodes 

ATTENDING [Name]

ASSISTANT [Fellow name]

SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Linear EBUS, Disposable Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).


Patient position: [Supine] 

Initial Airway Inspection: Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots.

EBUS STAGING The EBUS bronchoscope was introduced. All lymph node stations were assessed.


Technique: Only lymph nodes measuring ≥5 mm in short axis were sampled. Sampling was performed by transbronchial needle aspiration using a 22-gauge needle.


Lymph Nodes Inspected: 4R, 4L, 7, 11Rs, 11Ri, 11L.

Stations Sampled:

Station 11L:

Size/Appearance: ≥10 mm on CT and hypermetabolic via PET-CT.

Sampling: 4 EBUS-guided TBNA biopsies obtained.

ROSE: Preliminary cytology reported as inadequate.

Station 7 (Subcarinal):

Size/Appearance: ≥10 mm on CT and hypermetabolic via PET-CT.

Sampling: 4 EBUS-guided TBNA biopsies obtained.

ROSE: Preliminary cytology reported as adequate and suggestive of Granulomas.

Station 11Ri:

Size/Appearance: ≥10 mm on CT and hypermetabolic via PET-CT.

Sampling: 4 EBUS-guided TBNA biopsies obtained.


Overall ROSE Diagnosis: Granulomas. Final Results: Pending.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.

Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.

Completion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
