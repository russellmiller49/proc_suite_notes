PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection: Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea, Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, and bilateral lobar carinas from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — LLL Nodule: A CT chest scan was utilized on a separate planning station to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic platform. Robotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration.


Target: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Anteromedial Segment of the LLL (Lb7/8). The target lesion was approximately 2.5 cm in diameter.


Navigation: Under navigational guidance, the catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.


rEBUS Verification: Radial EBUS was performed, confirming the nodule location was eccentric. Features noted included a continuous margin and absence of a linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Cone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): A low-dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. 3D reconstructions were performed and interpreted on an independent workstation.


Adjustment: Using the newly acquired nodule location from the Cios Spin system, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.

LLL Target Sampling:

TBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 21G needle through the extended working channel. Total 4 samples were collected and sent for Microbiology and Cytology.

Cryobiopsy: Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with a 1.1mm cryoprobe (freeze time 6 seconds). Total 8 samples were collected and sent for Microbiology and Pathology. This required substantially greater work (>40%) due to increased intensity and technical difficulty.


Fiducial: A fiducial marker loaded with bone wax was placed under fluoroscopy guidance prior to withdrawal.

Brushing: Transbronchial brushing was performed with a protected cytology brush. 1 sample was collected for Cytology.


Lavage (BAL): Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the target site (20 cc instilled, 5 cc returned) and sent for Microbiology. Additional lavage was performed at the Superior (LB6), Anteromedial (Lb7/8), Lateral-basal (LB9), and Posterior-Basal (LB10) segments of the LLL (40 cc instilled, 15 cc returned) and sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.


ROSE: Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) from the Ion procedure noted: Fungus.

EBUS Staging: The linear EBUS scope was introduced. All lymph node stations were assessed; only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were considered for sampling. Endobronchial ultrasound elastography was used to assess stiffness (Type 1–3) to guide selection.

Station 11L: < 10 mm on CT. Demonstrated Type 2 elastographic pattern (mixed soft/stiff). Not sampled.

Station 4L (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm on CT. Type 2 pattern. Not sampled.

Station 7 (Subcarinal): < 10 mm on CT. Type 2 pattern. Not sampled.

Station 4R (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm on CT. Type 2 pattern. Not sampled.

Station 11Ri: < 10 mm on CT. Type 2 pattern. Not sampled.

No biopsies were taken based upon ultrasound appearance.

Conclusion: Therapeutic aspiration was repeated to clean the airways of mucus and blood. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.
