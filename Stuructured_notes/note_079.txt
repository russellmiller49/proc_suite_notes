INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 60-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure and neck mass. The patient required bronchoscopy for evaluation of the neck mass with extrinsic compression. The patient had a history of prolonged intubation at an outside hospital (~2 weeks).

CONSENT The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure were discussed. The patient/surrogate understood and agreed to proceed.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
Initial Assessment and Airway Management After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed. The patient was positioned supine. Initial inspection revealed the endotracheal tube (ETT) in good position, though the tube itself had flaking/peeling plastic along its length. The pharynx, larynx, and vocal cords were not initially assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through the ETT.

Therapeutic Aspiration and Lavage Secretions were noted to be a large burden, thick, and clear bilaterally. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the Distal 1/3 Trachea, Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the Lateral Segment (RB4) and Medial Segment (RB5) of the Right Middle Lobe (RML). 40 cc of normal saline was instilled with 15 cc returned. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.

Rigid Bronchoscopy and Difficult Intubation A black rigid barrel tracheoscope was introduced side-by-side with the ETT. Upon removal of the ETT, moderate blood was noted in the oropharynx, and there was anterior and left displacement of the airway. The glottic inlet could not be fully appreciated, and the patient began to desaturate; intubation was aborted and the patient was re-recruited with bag-mask ventilation.

For the second attempt, a red short barrel was used. The vocal cords were only partially identified, but the rigid bronchoscope was successfully advanced into the trachea. Once positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated. This process constituted a very challenging rigid bronchoscopy intubation due to deviated upper airway anatomy and stenosis.


Findings: Severe extrinsic compression from the posterior membrane was noted at the proximal trachea (subglottic space), displacing the trachea anteriorly.

Stenosis Measurements: Distance from vocal folds to stenosis: 5 mm; Length of stenosis: 5.5 cm; Distance from bottom of stenosis to carina: 5.7 cm.


Vocal Cords: Left vocal cord erythema/injury was noted.

EBUS Staging and Elastography Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed for diagnostic staging. All lymph node stations were assessed, and those ≥5 mm were sampled. Elastography was used to assess tissue stiffness (Type 1–3) to guide biopsy selection.


Station 11Rs (<10mm): Type 3 elastographic pattern (predominantly stiff/blue), raising concern for malignancy. 4 TBNA biopsies obtained.


Station 4R (≥10mm): Type 3 elastographic pattern (predominantly stiff/blue), raising concern for malignancy. 5 TBNA biopsies obtained.


Station 7 (<10mm): Type 2 elastographic pattern (mixed soft/stiff). TBNA directed at representative areas; 4 biopsies obtained.


Station 4L (<10mm): Type 2 elastographic pattern (mixed soft/stiff). TBNA directed at representative areas; 5 biopsies obtained.


Station 11L (<10mm): Type 3 elastographic pattern (predominantly stiff/blue), raising concern for malignancy. 4 TBNA biopsies obtained.


Tracheal Mass (≥10mm): 8 EBUS-guided TBNA biopsies and 5 transbronchial cryobiopsies were obtained.


ROSE Results: Preliminary ROSE cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of malignancy.

Tracheostomy (ENT Consult) Given the prolonged intubation, distorted anatomy, tracheal stenosis, and possible vocal cord injury, an intraoperative ENT consultation was requested. The ENT team reviewed the case and proceeded with surgical tracheostomy placement under the same anesthesia. The rigid tracheoscope was removed, and the patient underwent fiberoptic intubation with a 7.0 ETT to facilitate the ENT procedure.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. Care was turned over to the anesthesia and ENT teams for tracheostomy.
