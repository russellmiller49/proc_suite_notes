INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 62-year-old male who presents with lung nodules requiring bronchoscopic diagnosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location. Initial Airway Inspection: Normal appearing airway anatomy and mucosa bilaterally to the segmental level. Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea, Mainstems, Bronchus Intermedius, Carina, and bilateral lobar carinas from mucus.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — LUL Nodule A CT-based navigation plan was loaded into the robotic platform and partial registration was completed.


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment of the LUL (LB1/2). The target lesion measured approximately 0.8 cm. The catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm from the target.


rEBUS Assessment: Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric nodule location with continuous margins and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Cone-Beam CT: A Cios Spin low-dose CT spin was performed. 3D reconstructions on the Ion workstation were used to adjust the robotic system to the precise nodule location.

Sampling:


TBNA: 21G needle, 4 samples collected.


Cryobiopsy: 1.1mm cryoprobe, 6-second freeze time, 10 samples collected.


Brushing: Protected cytology brush, 1 sample collected.


BAL: 20 cc instilled, 5 cc return.


Fiducial: A fiducial marker with bone wax was placed under fluoroscopy guidance.


ROSE: No evidence of malignant neoplasm.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) — RUL Nodule


Navigation: The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical Segment of the RUL (RB1). The target lesion measured approximately 0.6 cm.


rEBUS Assessment: Radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric nodule location with continuous margins and absence of linear-discrete air bronchogram.


Cone-Beam CT: Cios Spin CT imaging and 3D reconstruction were used to confirm and adjust nodule location.

Sampling:


TBNA: 21G needle, 4 samples collected.


Cryobiopsy: 1.1mm cryoprobe, 6-second freeze time, 6 samples collected.


Brushing: Protected cytology brush, 1 sample collected.


BAL: 20 cc instilled, 5 cc return.


ROSE: Atypical cells present but no evidence of malignant neoplasm.

Additional Bronchoalveolar Lavage

LUL Lobar Lavage: Performed at LB1/2, LB3, LB4, and LB5. Instilled 40 cc, returned 15 cc.

RUL Lobar Lavage: Performed at RB1, RB2, and RB3. Instilled 40 cc, returned 15 cc.

EBUS Inspection A linear EBUS scope was used to assess lymph node stations. Only nodes ≥5 mm were considered for sampling.


Nodes Inspected: 4R, 4L, 7, 11Rs, 11Ri, 11L.


Elastography: EBUS elastography was performed to assess stiffness. Stations 11L, 4L, and 7 demonstrated Type 2 patterns (mixed soft/stiff).

Outcome: All assessed nodes (11L, 4L, 7) were <10 mm on CT. Based on size and ultrasound appearance, biopsies were not clinically indicated and were not taken.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.
