INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 74-year-old female who presents with hemoptysis after bronchoscopy. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Hemoptysis 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Hemoptysis 

PROCEDURE

31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 

31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing 

Bronchial blocker exchange and positioning 

ANESTHESIA Continuous sedation 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Disposable Bronchoscope; 7 Fr Arndt bronchial blocker.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). Patient Position: Supine 

Initial Airway Inspection: The bronchoscope was introduced into the ETT. The ETT is 2 cm above the main carina. The bronchial blocker was in the RLL but was mostly deflated without evidence of spill over into the other segments.

Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the LLL and LMSB from mucus.

Bronchial Blocker Exchange: The balloon was fully deflated and then removed. Then a new 7 Fr Arndt bronchial blocker was replaced through the existing ETT. The blocker was positioned in the distal BI. 3 mL of air was introduced into the blocker and resulted in occlusion of the BI without occlusion of the RUL.

Surveillance and Completion: During exchange of the bronchial blocker there was no increase in the blood seen in the RLL lateral segment. This was not aspirated due to no obvious formed clot.

The bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.

SPECIMEN(S) None 

IMPRESSION / PLAN [REDACTED] is a 74-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for hemoptysis.


Blocker Management: Keep blocker in place at 40 cm at the connective device.


Airway Management: ETT at 20 cm at the front tooth.


Medication/Follow-up: Stop paralysis; once this is not effective stop fentanyl and repeat bronchoscopy at 1500 today.


Communication: Family updated.
