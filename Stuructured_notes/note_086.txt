NOTE_ID:  note_086 SOURCE_FILE: note_086.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified
PROCEDURE:  
31899 Unlisted Procedure (Trach Change with Mature Tract or Procedure NOS)
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  Sedation initiated.  LMA placed.
The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.  Endobronchial topical lidocaine applied to the vocal cords, main carina, right carina 1, and left carina 2.
Initial Airway Examination Findings:
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Chords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Mildy tortuous, otherwise normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Right Lung Proximal Airways: The right anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures at site; mild stenosis of right anastomosis without dehiscence. The RUL and RB1-3 were normal to segmental level. The bronchus intermedius and more distal lobes/airways are mildly rotated clockwise.  The RML bronchus with moderate stenosis - estimate ~5mm patent; unable to traverse with therapeutic bronchoscope.  The RML mucosa has an anthracotic appearance to it.  However, this is overall the best I have seen his RML look before an intervention; no associated granulation tissue.  Able to visualize patent RB5/RB5.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: The left anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures at site; mild stenosis of left anastomosis. The LUL bronchus and LB1-3 were normal to first subsegmental level. The lingula is patent and LB4-5 are normal to first subsegmental level - able to traverse lingular bronchus with therapeutic bronchoscope. LLL and LB6-10 have normal anatomic branching to segmental level. No other evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology. 
Mucosa: Normal except as described above.
Secretions: Moderate, thin, and clear  All secretions were suctioned to clear (therapeutic aspiration). 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, left lower lobe from mucus. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at right middle lobe (Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5)).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 15 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Residual secretions, saline suctioned to clear.  No bleeding.  Bronchoscope removed.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient's LMA was removed in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
SPECIMEN(S): 
RML BAL - cell count, cultures/micro, cytology
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for airway evaluation and BAL.
-RML bronchus appears overall the best I have seen it at the beginning of the bronchoscopy; no granulation tissue or signs of irritation.  Although unable to traverse with therapeutic bronchoscope, the RB4 and RB5 subsegments are grossly patent.  Therefore, to hopefully avoid undo inflammation, no dilation or other intervention was performed today.
-Repeat bronchoscopy in 2-3 weeks to confirm stability of RML bronchus.  Consideration of interventions depending on appearance of airway.
