INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 57-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis. This patient is a transplant recipient with stenosis that required increased complexity, specifically 4 balloon dilations and 6 applications of cryotherapy. This resulted in >50% increased work due to time, technical difficulty, and physical/mental effort required.

CONSENT The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; 1.7mm Cryoprobe; 6/7/8 Elation balloon.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).


Patient Position: Supine 

Initial Airway Inspection: The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Airway Exam:


Stenosis: Notable for stenosis of the RML (75% patent). Diameter was 5-6 mm.


Secretions: Moderate clear secretions bilaterally, white thicker mucus emanating from RML.

Therapeutic Aspiration & Lavage: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug.

Endobronchial Stenosis Treatment: Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:


Cryotherapy: Using a 1.7mm probe, ablation was performed with 30-second freeze-thaw cycles for a total of 6 applications.


Balloon Dilation: Performed at RML using a 6/7/8 Elation balloon to dilate to 8 mm. Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each were performed during this specific sequence.

Results: Prior to treatment, affected airway was noted to be 75% patent. After treatment, the airway was 100% patent.

Conclusion: The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was successfully extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
