ASSISTANT [Fellow name]

SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope; Electrocautery (Needle Knife); Cryoprobe (1.7mm); Elation Balloon (6/7/8).

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Patient Position: [Position] Initial Airway Inspection: The laryngeal mask airway is in good position. The vocal cords appear normal. The subglottic space is normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Airway Findings:

Airway exam notable for stenosis of the RML (25% patent).

Moderate clear secretions bilaterally, white thicker mucus eminating from RML.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus and mucus plug.

Endobronchial Stenosis Destruction Endobronchial obstruction at RML was treated with the following modalities:


Electrocautery: Needle Knife (EndoCut I, Effect 3, 3d/2i) used for radial cuts.


Cryotherapy: 1.7mm cryoprobe used for ablation (30sec freeze-thaw cycles).

Balloon Dilation Balloon dilation was performed at RML.


Dilation 1: 6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 6 mm at the RML. Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.


Dilation 2: 6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML. Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.

Results Prior to treatment, affected airway was noted to be 25% patent. After treatment, the airway was 100% patent.

The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

SPECIMEN(S) None 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

[REDACTED] is a 57-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial stenosis.

RML airway moderately stenosed again; treated with repeat dilation and touch cryotherapy.

Plan for bronchoscopy with dilation in 2 weeks.
