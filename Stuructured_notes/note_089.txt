SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Electrocautery (knife); Elation balloon (6/7/8).

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Patient Position [Supine] 

Initial Airway Inspection Right middle lobe orifice was significantly narrowed. Prior to treatment, the affected airway was noted to be 10% patent.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem and Bronchus Intermedius from mucus.

Right Middle Lobe Intervention Endobronchial obstruction at the RML orifice was treated with the following modalities:


Electrocautery: Using an electrocautery knife (setting endoI 4, 4, 1), radial cuts were made for a duration of 4 seconds.


Balloon Dilation: A 6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the right middle lobe orifice. Total of 3 inflations were performed with a dilation time of 60 seconds each.

Results After treatment, the airway was 100% patent.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

SPECIMENS

None 

IMPRESSION / PLAN

57-year-old male who presented for bronchoscopy for airway narrowing.

Significant RML stenosis treated with electrocautery radial cuts and balloon dilation; airway patency improved from 10% to 100%.


Next Step: 2 weeks follow-up bronchoscopy (order placed with level 2).
