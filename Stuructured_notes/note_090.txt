INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 57-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy, balloon dilation, and cryotherapy were discussed with the patient in detail. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. Consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

ASSISTANT [Fellow name]

SUPPORT STAFF RN: [Name] RT: [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope; 6/7/8 mm Elation balloon; 1.7 mm Cryoprobe; Alligator forceps.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Trivial 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location). Sedation was initiated and an LMA was placed.

Initial Airway Inspection The Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope was advanced for airway examination.


Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions; appropriate abduction (adduction not assessed due to paralysis).


Trachea: Mildly tortuous, otherwise normal.


Main Carina: Sharp.


Right Lung Proximal Airways: The right anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures; mild stenosis noted without dehiscence. The RUL and RB1-3 were normal to the segmental level. The bronchus intermedius and distal airways were mildly rotated clockwise.


Right Middle Lobe (RML): The proximal take-off appeared normal, but severe stenosis (~3mm patent) was noted starting halfway into the bronchus. A second area of moderate stenosis (~5mm) was noted just before the take-off of RB4 and RB5. The stenosis appeared circumferential due to fibrotic and granulation tissue, with a small patch of white debris overlying the area.

Right Lower Lobe (RLL): Able to enter truncus basalis with mild pressure; RB7 was compressed and fish-mouthed. RB6 and RB8-10 showed normal anatomic branching.


Left Lung Proximal Airways: Left anastomosis intact with visible blue sutures and mild stenosis. LUL, Lingula, and LLL showed normal branching to the segmental/subsegmental level.


Secretions: Moderate, thin, and clear secretions noted generally; moderate white secretions (likely mucostasis) suctioned from RB4/RB5 after relief of stenosis.

Interventions


Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the trachea, bilateral mainstems, RUL, bronchus intermedius, RML, RLL, LUL, and LLL.


Endobronchial Biopsy: A biopsy was performed at the white patch of tissue in the RML bronchus; the lesion was successfully removed and sent for tissue culture.

Cryotherapy & Debridement (RML): Endobronchial obstruction at the RML bronchus was treated to relieve stenosis.


Cryotherapy: Overlapping treatments (30 seconds each) were performed using a 1.7mm cryoprobe on the circumferential stenosis in the middle and distal RML bronchus, leading to softening of fibrotic and granulation tissue.


Excision: Tissue debris causing obstruction was excised via mechanical debridement using bland alligator forceps.

Balloon Dilation (RML): Balloon dilation was performed using a 6/7/8 Elation balloon with the following sequence:


RML Bronchus: Dilated to 7 mm (60 seconds).


RML Bronchus: Dilated to 8 mm (60 seconds).


RML Bronchus: Dilated to 8 mm (60 seconds).


RML Medial Segment: Dilated to 6 mm (60 seconds).


RML Lateral Segment: Dilated to 6 mm (60 seconds).

Final Assessment & Lavage Despite multiple dilations, the RML bronchus continued to mildly narrow, particularly at the distal end. The therapeutic bronchoscope could not traverse the entire length of the RML bronchus. A hybrid bronchoscope was advanced, confirming patency of RB4 and RB5 to their respective subsegments.


Patency: Improved from 30% pre-treatment to 75% post-treatment.


Hemostasis: Trivial bleeding was controlled with suction and saline.

BAL: Performed at the Lateral (RB4) and Medial (RB5) segments of the RML. Instilled 60 cc NS, returned 20 cc NS.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The LMA was removed in the OR and the patient was transported to recovery in stable condition.

IMPRESSION / PLAN [REDACTED] is a 57-year-old male with bronchial stenosis who underwent bronchoscopy for balloon dilation, cryotherapy, and airway clearance.


Follow-up: Repeat bronchoscopy in 2 weeks for airway evaluation, dilation, and possible stent placement.


Stent Consideration: Will review with IP providers regarding 8x20mm stent vs. custom silicone stent placement.


Results: Will request lung transplant team follow-up on EBBx culture and BAL results.
