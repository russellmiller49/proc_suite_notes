INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: Monday, February 9, 2026 INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 57-year-old male who presents with airway stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure.

Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.

The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

PROCEDURE

31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 

31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing 

31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL) 

31630 Balloon dilation 

31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 

31641 Destruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy) 

31899NFD BRONCHOSCOPY W/ APPLICATION OF TRANEXAMIC ACID 

31635 Foreign body removal 

Modifier 22 (Unusual Procedural Services): Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty). This patient required multiple (5) separate applications of spray cryotherapy and required multiple forms of bronchoscopy (flexible and rigid) in order to adequately treat the patient. This resulted in >50% increased work due to time, technical difficulty, and physical/mental effort.

ATTENDING [REDACTED]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Rigid Bronchoscope; Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Flexible Bronchoscopy & Stent Removal The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced through the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), which was in good position.


Airway Inspection: The vocal cords were normal without mass/lesions. The anterior trachea showed a well-healed tracheostomy site but was otherwise normal. The main carina was sharp.


Right Lung: Anastomosis sutures were intact with a somewhat tortuous bronchus intermedius. The RML had a stent in place. Normal anatomic branching was noted to the segmental level with no evidence of mass, lesions, or other pathology.


Left Lung: Anastomosis sutures were intact with normal anatomic branching and no endobronchial pathology.


Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the distal trachea, bilateral mainstems, and lobar carinas.

During initial gentle suctioning/therapeutic aspiration at the RML, the iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent became dislodged and completely extruded from the RML into the distal bronchus intermedius.


Foreign Body Removal: The stent was grasped with pulmonary forceps and removed en bloc with the therapeutic bronchoscope.


Hemostasis: Oozing blood from the distal RML bronchus was noted after dislodgement. Bleeding was easily controlled with endobronchial cold saline, epinephrine 0.2mg, and tranexamic acid 200mg.

Rigid Bronchoscopy & Intervention After induction of muscle relaxants, the LMA was removed and a tooth protector placed. The black bronchoscope ventilating rigid barrel was introduced and advanced to the mid-trachea; jet ventilation was initiated. The barrel was positioned into the proximal right mainstem bronchus.

The area of stenosis at the right middle lobe was treated with the following modalities:


Mechanical Debridement: Pulmonary alligator forceps were used for good granulation tissue removal from the distal RML bronchus.


Cryospray: A cryotherapy catheter was used (low-flow) for 5 applications of 10 seconds each, providing excellent application to the proximal RML bronchus and around the take-off.


Balloon Dilation: An 8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to dilate the RML Carina (RC2) to 10 mm. Two total inflations were performed with a dilation time of 60 seconds each.


Results: Prior to treatment, the affected airway was 70% patent; after treatment, it was 90% patent. The RML was widely patent with patent segmental airways following extraction, excision, and dilation. The decision was made not to place another stent at this time to allow for a "stent vacation" to break the chain of bacterial colonization and observe tissue response to cryospray.

Final Flexible Bronchoscopy The rigid bronchoscope was extubated and the LMA was replaced by the anesthesia team. The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced.


Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Performed at the Lateral Segment of the RML (RB4). 40 cc of NS was instilled with a return of 20 cc. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.

The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.
