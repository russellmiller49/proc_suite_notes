INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Name / Self, Referred]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 56-year-old male who presents with bronchial stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure. Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed. The patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Bronchial stenosis 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

Bronchial stenosis 

PROCEDURE

31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode 

31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing 

31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL) 

31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s) 

31630 Balloon dilation 

31636 Dilate and bronchial stent initial bronchus 

31638 Revision of tracheal/bronchial stent 

31640 Bronchoscopy with excision 

31635 Foreign body removal 

22 Substantially greater work than normal (increased intensity, time, technical difficulty, severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort).

Justification: Due to small right mainstem diameter, it was difficult to use the therapeutic bronchoscope. At times, a disposable bronchoscope was introduced via the mouth alongside the therapeutic bronchoscope going through the tracheostomy tube. This resulted in >40% increased work.

ATTENDING [Name]

ANESTHESIA General Anesthesia 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Disposable Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Minimum 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.

Initial Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was advanced into the existing tracheostomy tube. A total of 4 mL of 2% lidocaine was instilled onto the main carina. The airways were examined to the subsegmental level bilaterally.


Right Lung: The right anastomosis was without dehiscence but showed white-yellow exudate along the anterior portion of the RMSB, extending down to the level of the RML ostium. A stent was visualized in the RML extending past the ostium; it was in appropriate position, but the distal portion did not appear fully extended.


Left Lung: The left anastomosis was intact with an area of granulation tissue but without significant stenosis. A white-yellow fibrinous plaque was noted along the LMSB extending to the ostium of the lingular bronchus.


Secretions: A moderate amount of thick, white mucus was found in the LLL and was therapeutically aspirated.

Interventions

1. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) BAL was performed at the Posterior-Basal Segment of the LLL (LB10). 60 cc of NS was instilled, and suction returned 15 cc of NS. Samples were sent for cell count and microbiology.

2. RML Stent Management (Dilation, Removal, Replacement) Balloon dilation of the existing RML bronchus stent was performed using a CRE 8-9-10 balloon. The stent was dilated x2 to 9 mm for 1 minute each dilation. The stent did not increase in diameter; it appeared too small for the airway and migrated distally.

Removal: A complex approach was required due to airway size. Using the therapeutic bronchoscope via the tracheostomy stoma and a disposable bronchoscope via the mouth, an attempt was made to reposition the stent. The stent (foreign body) was grasped with forceps and removed en bloc from the RML via the tracheostomy stoma. Examination showed the stent did not dilate past 7 mm.


Replacement: The bronchoscope was introduced into the mouth and advanced through the vocal cords into the trachea past the partially deflated cuff of the tracheostomy tube. A jag wire was introduced into the RML. Under direct visualization, an 8 x 15 mm Aero SEM stent was deployed into the RML bronchus. The stent was revised with forceps; position was adequate, and distal airways were patent.

3. Left Side Management The lingular bronchus was dilated to 8 mm with improvement in diameter. Fibrinous/yellow-white tumor tissue was removed with forceps at the lingular ostium and LMSB.

Conclusion There was no evidence of active bleeding, and the bronchoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was transitioned to mechanical ventilation and returned to the ICU to recover.
