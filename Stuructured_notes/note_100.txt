INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT

INDICATION FOR OPERATION [REDACTED] is a 56-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure and bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

J96.90 Respiratory Failure 

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS

J96.90 Respiratory Failure 

PROCEDURE

Therapeutic aspiration, subsequent episodes (CPT 31646) 

Diagnostic bronchoscopy with cell washing (CPT 31622) 

ANESTHESIA Local ONLY. Lidocaine applied to trachea, main carina, RMS, and LMS.

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Disposable Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None.

COMPLICATIONS None.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Airway Inspection


Trachea: The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber and the carina is sharp.


Extent: The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Right Lung Findings:

Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the Right Mainstem Bronchus (RMSB), Bronchus Intermedius (BI), and Right Middle Lobe (RML) orifice.

The previously seen metallic hemoclip near the RMS anastomosis posterior membrane is no longer present.

The RML orifice is now completely stenosed by overlying necrotic debris.

Unable to probe into the airway to achieve patency.

Left Lung Findings:

The Left Mainstem Bronchus (LMSB) anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB.

Segmental airways on the left are widely patent.


Secretions: Clear secretions noted bilaterally.

Interventions


Therapeutic Aspiration: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, and RLL and LLL from mucus.

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.

SPECIMEN(S) None.

IMPRESSION / PLAN

Plan for bronchoscopy under GA for management of RML stenosis—likely excision of overlying debris, balloon dilation, and stent placement.

Likely on [REDACTED].
