DATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] CC Referred Physician: [Referred Physician Name]

INDICATION FOR OPERATION The patient is a 56-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. The patient also presents for bronchoscopy for bronchial anastomotic dehiscence and stenosis. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.

CONSENT Obtained before the procedure.

Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.

Consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.

31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing 

31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL) 

ANESTHESIA Local ONLY 

MONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

INSTRUMENTATION Disposable Bronchoscope.

ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None 

COMPLICATIONS None 

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).

Initial Airway Inspection The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Airway Findings


Right Lung: Airway exam was notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the Right Mainstem Bronchus (RMSB), Bronchus Intermedius (BI), and Right Middle Lobe (RML) orifice. The RMSB anastomosis continues to show a partially exposed hemoclip along the posterior membrane. The RML orifice is stenosed to ~75% of its normal patency.


Left Lung: The Left Mainstem Bronchus (LMSB) anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent.


Secretions: Clear secretions bilaterally.

Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the Anterior-basal Segment of the RLL (RB8).

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.

Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).

Conclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
