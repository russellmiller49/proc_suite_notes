NOTE_ID:  note_101 SOURCE_FILE: note_101.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure. The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
ANESTHESIA: 
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for persistent pale plaque of tissue along the anterior wall of the RMSB/BI and RML orifice. The RMSB anastomosis continues to show a partially exposed hemoclip along the posterior membrane. The RML orifice is stenosed to ~75% of its normal patency. The LMSB anastomosis shows mild granulation tissue and similar pale soft tissue plaque along the anterior aspect of the distal LMSB. Segmental airways on the left are widely patent. Clear secretions bilaterally. 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anterior-basal Segment of RLL (RB8).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 10 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count and Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal).
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.
