NOTE_ID:  note_104 SOURCE_FILE: note_104.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with respiratory failure.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J96.90 Respiratory Failure
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J96.90 Respiratory Failure
PROCEDURE:  
31646 Therapeutic aspiration subsequent episodes
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31630 Balloon dilation
50 Bilateral Procedures (Procedure done on both sides of the body)
IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required a bilateral procedure today when this procedure would typically be unilateral. Apply to: 31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    . 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimum
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The airway was inspected from above the tracheostomy tube. The vocal cords were normal appearing. The trach was in good position and the balloon was inflated. Secretions were suctioned and lidocaine was applied.
The airway was inspected via the tracheostomy. The right sided stent was in good position. There was significant necrosis/granulation tissue around the suture site and medially along the transplanted lung. This covered the orifice of the right middle lobe. The right lower lobe was preserved. The portion of the right upper lobe take off visible through the stent appeared intact, but there was an area around 9 o'clock which could be injured.
The left lung anastamosis site had similar medial necrosis and granulation tissue. The lingula was patent but obscured with the necrosis. The left upper lobe anterior segment had some necrosis and the left upper lobe proper was preserved. The left lower lobe was preserved.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology. 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm and to 9 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 2 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Right middle lobe BAL
Right middle lobe EBBX
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for respiratory failure and airway dilation.
-Follow up bronchoscopic lab work
-Follow up bronchoscopy later this week or early next week
