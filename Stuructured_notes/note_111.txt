NOTE_ID:  note_111 SOURCE_FILE: note_111.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents with Pleural Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Chest tube placement were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pleural Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32557 Insert catheter pleura with imaging (chest tube)
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid and air bubbles. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.
