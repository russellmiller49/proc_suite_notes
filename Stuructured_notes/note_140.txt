NOTE_ID:  note_140 SOURCE_FILE: note_140.txt Procedure: Bronchoscopy with radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS)
Indication: Esophageal cancer with suspected malignant airway involvement
Anesthesia/Ventilation: General anesthesia with controlled mechanical ventilation. Topical 2% lidocaine to tracheobronchial tree (6 mL).
Pre-procedure status: ASA III. Standard consent and time-out performed. Labs and imaging reviewed.

Technique

Q180 slim video bronchoscope introduced via tracheostomy to the tracheobronchial tree.

T180 therapeutic bronchoscope also introduced via tracheostomy.

UM-BS20-26R 20 MHz radial probe ultrasound advanced through the working channel to assess airway wall and adjacent structures.

Airway Examination

Tracheostomy stoma: Normal.

Trachea: Normal caliber.

Carina: Sharp.

Bronchial tree: Examined to at least the first subsegmental level.

Mucosa/anatomy: Normal throughout; no endobronchial lesions and no secretions.

Radial Probe Ultrasound Findings

Radial EBUS performed at:

Proximal left mainstem bronchus takeoff

Mid and distal trachea

Esophageal tumor visualized infiltrating the adventitia of the posterior wall of the left mainstem bronchus.

Minimum distance from esophageal mass to left mainstem bronchial lumen: 3.2 mm.

No intraluminal airway invasion identified on bronchoscopic inspection.

Impression

Malignant extrinsic airway involvement from esophageal cancer, affecting the adventitia of the posterior wall of the left mainstem bronchus.

No endobronchial disease and no intrinsic airway obstruction at time of examination.

Findings suggest high-risk proximity of tumor to airway, relevant for oncologic planning and future airway risk assessment.

Complications / Blood Loss

No immediate complications.

Estimated blood loss: None.

Specimens: None collected.

Post-Procedure Plan

Routine post-procedure observation until discharge criteria met.

Follow-up with primary/oncology team as previously scheduled.
