NOTE_ID:  note_146 SOURCE_FILE: note_146.txt Procedure: Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy, tumor debulking, APC ablation, and silicone Y-stent placement
Indication: Mediastinal adenopathy, diagnostic and therapeutic
Anesthesia: General anesthesia; topical 2% lidocaine to tracheobronchial tree (10 mL)

Pre-Procedure

Standard informed consent and time-out performed.

History/physical updated; labs and imaging reviewed.

Patient tolerated induction and procedure well.

Technique

Rigid bronchoscopy: Black bronchial tube 12.0–11.0 via mouth with 0° 4.0-mm rigid telescope.

Flexible bronchoscopy: Q180 slim and T180 therapeutic bronchoscopes passed through the rigid bronchoscope.

Therapeutic tools: Electrocautery snare, XPS 3000 microdebrider, ERBE APC VIO 300D (argon plasma coagulation).

Airway Findings

Vocal cords: Normal mobility.

Subglottis: Normal.

Proximal trachea: Normal caliber.

Distal trachea / carina:

Mixed obstruction (extrinsic compression + endoluminal tumor) arising from the right lateral distal trachea, extending to involve the main carina and both mainstem bronchi over ~1 cm.

~75% luminal occlusion in the lower trachea.

Carinal mass large, friable, infiltrative, and submucosal with prominent endobronchial component.

Interventions

Electrocautery snare debulking of carinal mass → ~60% recanalization at carina.

Resected tissue sent to pathology.

Endobronchial biopsies (cup forceps) from lower trachea and carina (5 samples) sent for histopathology.

Microdebrider resection of additional lower tracheal tumor → partial recanalization to ~50% of normal.

APC ablation to residual tumor in the trachea, carina, left and right mainstem bronchi → post-ablation lumen ~70% of normal.

Airway stenting:

Silicone Y-stent (Novatec 14–10–10 mm) selected and customized (6 cm tracheal limb; 1 cm each mainstem limb).

Deployed under direct vision across trachea, carina, and both mainstem bronchi.

Post-stent lumen ~90% of normal; no airway orifices obstructed; final position satisfactory.

Complications / Blood Loss

No immediate complications.

Estimated blood loss: < 5 cc.

Impression

Severe malignant airway obstruction at the distal trachea/carina with bilateral mainstem involvement.

Technically successful rigid bronchoscopy with diagnostic biopsies, multimodal tumor debulking/ablation, and silicone Y-stent placement resulting in substantial airway patency restoration.

Post-Procedure Plan

Observe in post-bronchoscopy recovery until discharge criteria met.

Await pathology results.

Follow up with requesting/oncology service to review final histopathology and guide definitive therapy.
