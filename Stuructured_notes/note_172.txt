NOTE_ID:  note_172 SOURCE_FILE: note_172.txt Indications: Left upper lobe nodule 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea is of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. All left and right sided airways were normal without endobronchial disease. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 7 and 11L. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed in these lymph nodes using an Olympus Vizishot  EBUS TBNA 19 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. We then tried to visualize the FDG avid station 5 lymph node seen on PET CT through the pulmonary artery but were unable to clearly visualize the node and thus could not sample from the mainstem approach (transvascular). We then removed the EBUS bronchoscopy. At this point the patient had lost her IV access and developed laryngospasm prompting us to bronchoscopically intubate the patient with a size 8.5 ETT which was easily passed through the vocal cords and into the lower trachea before being secured in place. The Q190 bronchscope was then advanced, using anatomical knowledge,  into the proximal left upper lobe adjacent to the station 5 lymph node and utilizing radial EBUS attempted to sample this node through an airway approach with a transbronchial needle approach. ROSE was unrevealing and we subsequently the super-dimension navigational catheter was inserted through the therapeutic bronchoscope and advanced into the airway. Using navigational map we advanced the 180 degree edge catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the left upper lobe. Confirmation of placement was attempted once we were in the vicinity of the point of interest with radial ultrasound. The lesion however could not be adequately visualized. Multiple attempts to navigate to the lesion were unfruitful and we subsequently completed the procedure without attempting to sample the left upper lobe peripheral lesion. 
Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: Less than 5 cc.
Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Negative Staging EBUS on preliminary evaluation 
- Flexible bronchoscopy with unsuccessful electromagnetic navigation to the left upper nodule
- Await final pathology  
- Discharge once post-op criteria met
