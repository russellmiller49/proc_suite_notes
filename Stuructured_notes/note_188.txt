NOTE_ID:  note_188 SOURCE_FILE: note_188.txt Procedure Name: EBUS bronchoscopy and peripheral biopsy
Indications: Pulmonary nodule requiring diagnosis/staging. 
Medications: Propofol infusion via anesthesia assistance  
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. 
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level without endobronchial lesions visualized. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) was only met in station station 7. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Onsite path evaluation revealed benign lymphocytes. The bronchoscope was then removed and the PX190 ultrathin video bronchoscope was inserted into the airway and based on anatomical knowledge advanced into the left upper lobe to the area of known nodule within the Apical-posterior segment the lesion was identified visually. Biopsies were then performed with micro forceps.  After adequate samples were obtained the bronchoscope was removed. ROSE was consistent with malignancy within the lesion.  The bronchoscope was then removed and the P190 re-inserted into the airways. We then observed for evidence of active bleeding and none was identified. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed. 
Complications: 	
-None 
Estimated Blood Loss:  less than 5 cc.
Recommendations:
- Transfer to post-op ward
- Await biopsy results 
- Discharge home once criteria met.
