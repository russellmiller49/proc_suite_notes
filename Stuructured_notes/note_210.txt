NOTE_ID:  note_210 SOURCE_FILE: note_210.txt After pt was induced by Anesthesia and LMA was placed, the OR table was rotated 180 degrees. The diagnostic bronchoscope was introduced and LMA placement was adjusted. Whitish nodules were noted on the right vocal cord. The scope was then passed into the trachea and the central airways were inspected. Moderate purulent secretions were noted at the RUL. The endobronchial mucosa of the RUL was edematous and friable and the apical subsegment bronchus appeared somewhat narrowed as though from extrinsic compression. 

The diagnostic scope was removed and the EBUS scope was introduced. The hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes were surveyed and all nodes were measured. The nodes that met criteria for sampling (i.e. >5mm short axis diameter) were then sampled by real time EBUS TBNA in the following order: 4R, 7, 2R, 10R, 11R. 

The EBUS scope was then removed and the diagnostic scope was introduced. Radial probe EBUS was inserted into the RUL apical subsegment until abnormal tissue was identified at approx 4cm from the end of the scope. This area was then biopsied with needle and brush. A BAL was then performed in the RUL. The central airways were inspected to confirm hemostasis and the scope was removed.
