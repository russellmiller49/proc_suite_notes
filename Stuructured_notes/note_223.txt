NOTE_ID:  note_223 SOURCE_FILE: note_223.txt PROCEDURE PERFORMED: flexible bronchoscopy with electrocautery tissue debulking and balloon dilatation. 
 INDICATIONS: complete lobar collapse  
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. There were red petechiae throughout the tracheal mucosa of unclear etiology. The trachea and right sided airways were otherwise normal. The left mainstem stent was widely patent without evidence of obstruction in the proximal and mid portions.  There was a small area of abnormal mucosal thickening in the proximal posterior wall which we attempted to biopsy with forceps but specimen was lost during forceps extraction. At the distal le mainstem there was complete obstruction secondary to circumferential fibrinous scar. We were able to identify a pin-hole using the thin bronchoscope but could not view distally of bypass with the scope. A Fogarty balloon was then passed through the hole and inflated and then retracted through the stenosis to gently dilate the airway. Purulent material was visualized and collected via trap. This was repeated multiple times with varying sized of Fogarty balloons.  The electrocautery knife was then used to make linear incisions within the scar after which serial proximal dilatations were performed with the 6,7,8 Merit phased dilatational balloon. Continued purulent return indicated intraluminal dilatation. We were eventually able to pass the central obstruction with the therapeutic bronchoscope but distal visualization was limited. With the P190X thin bronchoscope we were able to visualize free wires from previous left upper lobe resection and stenotic distal airways with associated bronchomalacia and adherent white waxy fibrinous tissue. While one airway was clearly visualized with distal carinas seen, the anatomy was extremely distorted and the extensive fibrinous material/inflammation made it impossible to confidently confirm that the other associated orifices e were not in a false lumen. At this point we obtained forceps biopsies from the abnormal tissue and the case was completed with plan to reassess after repeat CT. 
Recommendations:
-	CXR in PACU
-	Transfer patient to ward
-	Repeat CT today
