POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Endotracheal tumor s/p debulking 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 
1.         Rigid bronchoscopy with endoluminal tumor ablation(CPT 31641)
INDICATIONS: Tracheal Obstruction  
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives and paralytics the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the LMA and into the pharynx. We then advanced the bronchoscope into the subglottic space. The subglottic area and proximal trachea were normal. At the level of the med trachea there was a large polypoid tumor with a ball valve effect with the base at the left posterior tracheal wall. The tumor was about 90% obstructive of the normal tracheal diameter. Additionally there wer multiple small polypoid lesions surrounding the large obstructive mass mostly on the posterior wall of the trachea but also on the anterior and right tracheal wall. These findings extended for about 3cm. We did not attempt to pass the polypoid lesion with the bronchoscope during the initial inspection.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 10mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the mid trachea just proximal to the tumor and connected to ventilator. The T190 Olympus flexible bronchoscope was then introduced through the rigid bronchoscope and the electrocautery snare was used to transect the obstructive mass at its base. We then inserted the 1.9mm cryotherapy probe through the flexible bronchoscope and attached the probe using cryotherapy to the resected tumor and attempted to extract it through the rigid bronchoscope. The tumor however was too large and repeatedly fell off of the cryoprobe when trying to pull it through the rigid scope. We then switched to the large 2.4mm cryoprobe and again using the same technique were able to pull pieces of the tumor out if a piecemeal fashion and residual pieces of the resected tumor were then extracted with flexible forceps. After the primary tumor was removed we then used APC to paint and shave the remaining tumor area on the posterior and lateral trachea walls until we were satisfied that we had achieved adequate luminal recanalization. At the end of the procedure the trachea was approximately 95% open in comparison to unaffected areas. We then were able to complete the distal airway inspection. The lower trachea, right sided and left sided airways to at least the first sub-segments were uninvolved with no evidence of endobronchial tumor or extrinsic obstruction. The rigid bronchoscope was then removed, and the procedure was completed. There were no complications.
Recommendations:
·           Transfer patient back to ICU 
·           Obtain post procedure CXR
·           Await final pathology results
