Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 60% obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass at area of known broncholith. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Gentle pressure was applied to the lesion with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with suction. This resulted in about 90% opening of the bronchus intermedius. There was some brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical ice saline and balloon tamponade. A small residual area of broncholith was seen and was extracted with flexible forceps.

The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. Inspection bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Subsequently a Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the superior segment of the lingula. Under fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance.

One specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. The patient did develop some minor hemorrhage which resolved after balloon occlusion. It was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.  A total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen.

The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken.

The proximal trachea was normal. The previously placed Y-stent was in appropriate position with thick mucus coating the inner aspect of the stent. The tracheal limb was about 40% obstructed with mucous, the right sided limb was about 60% obstructed and the left sided limb was completely obstructed. The flexible bronchoscope with suction was used to re-canulate the stent and saline instillation was used to thin the adherent mucous to allow for further removal via suction.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the mid trachea. rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. Post stent removal the airways were widely patent. White plaques were seen in the posterior aspect of the right mainstem and left mainstem consistent with post-treatment effects from tumor. At the location of distal edge of the removed stent granulation tissue was seem both in the BI and the left mainstem. Cryotherapy was performed with three 30 second freeze thaw cycles in the areas of granulation. After this further suction was performed of residual mucous from the more distal airways. Once we were confident that the airways were patent and there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed, and the patient turned over to anesthesia who extubated the patient in the OR.  \nComplications: None  \nRecommendations: \n- Transfer to PACU \n- Obtain post procedure CXR \n- Discharge to home once criteria met.  \n \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nBalboa Ambulatory Surgery Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_006"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 60% obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass at area of known broncholith. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Gentle pressure was applied to the lesion with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with suction. This resulted in about 90% opening of the bronchus intermedius. There was some brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical ice saline and balloon tamponade. A small residual area of broncholith was seen and was extracted with flexible forceps.

A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Following rigid intubation the patient developed unexpected hypoxia of unclear etiology although visible chest rise was seen.  Decision was made to extubate and then re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope using closed assisted ventilation.  After re-intubating with a similar technique the mouth was packed and the nose was plugged to avoid leak. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease. No evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes. ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice.

The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe. Gentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter. Once this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None \nRecommendations:  \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met. \n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week. \n \nJeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_011"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.

After the second biopsy, significant blood was encountered when the balloon was deflated. The balloon was reinflated for 5 minutes to protect against blood soiling the airways, and 20cc of iced saline was instilled through the blocker to promote hemostasis. The balloon was released again, and bleeding was noted to have stopped. One more biopsy was completed in the segment for a total of 3. Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed. \n \nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.  \n \nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube. A 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement. The needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place. A guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn. A 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated. The 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.  \n \nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed. \n \nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc \nComplications: Pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion \n \nAssessment and Plan: \n- Successful lung cryobiopsy complicated by pneumothorax requiring pigtail insertion \n- CXR pending \n- Admit to Internal medicine for chest tube management \n- Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \nCDR Cody Adams, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology Staff \nPacific Regional Medical Center \nNAME: JESSICA ROSS: 19092357923", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_003"}

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n·       Transfer to PACU \n·       Obtain post-procedure chest x-ray. \n·       Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease. \n·       Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent. \n·       Management of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed. \n·       Plan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen). \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nHorizon University Medical Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_005"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen.

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n·       Transfer to PACU \n·       Obtain post-procedure chest x-ray. \n·       Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease. \n·       Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent. \n·       Management of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed. \n·       Plan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen). \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nHorizon University Medical Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_005"}

Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n·       Transfer to PACU \n·       Obtain post-procedure chest x-ray. \n·       Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease. \n·       Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent. \n·       Management of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed. \n·       Plan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen). \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nPacific Regional Medical Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_005"}

All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. There was significant distortion of the right sided airways with approximately 60% obstruction from external compression (seen on CT and known to be due to “pinching” from the spine and pulmonary artery).

It was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.  A total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously. \n·       Patient to PACU \n·       CXR pending \n·       Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \n \n \n·       NAME: AMBER SANDOVAL·       DOD NUMBER: 932654340\n·       Proceduralist(s): \n·        Jeffery Chastain MD \n·       Assistants:  \n·       Paul Cusmano MD (Fellow) \n·       Brian Tran MD (Fellow) \n·       Procedure NAME: AMBER SANDOVAL(pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies \n·       CPT code(s): CPT 320098 Thoracotomy, with biopsy(ies) of pleura \n·       Indications: Left sided pleural effusion \n·       Medications: As per anesthesia record \n·       Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, a 14 French pigtail catheter was inserted through the port site and attached to pleuro-vac with suction.

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n·       Transfer to PACU \n·       Obtain post-procedure chest x-ray. \n·       Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease. \n·       Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent. \n·       Management of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed. \n·       Plan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen). \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nNaval Medical Center San Diego", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_005"}

After receiving analgesia and paralytics, the patient was mask-bagged and once preoxygenated, an 8.0 endotracheal tube was inserted bronchoscopically using an Olympus T180 therapeutic bronchoscope with an Arent enbobronchial blocker attached to the bronchoscope externally. The blocker was then advanced into the right lower lobe, and the endotracheal tube was advanced over the bronchoscope into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator.  \n \nAfter an unremarkable inspection bronchoscopy, the 2.4 mm reusable ERBE cryoprobe was inserted through the past the balloon into the right lower lobe anterior segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached, the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm, and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds. The flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were then removed en-bloc, and the endobronchial blocker balloon was immediately inflated after removal. One specimen was obtained from the cryoprobe, the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted, and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. No blood was noted, and this was repeated for a total of 5 biopsies. \n \nCryobiopsies were then performed in the lateral segment of the right lower lobe using the same technique. After the second biopsy, significant blood was encountered when the balloon was deflated. The balloon was reinflated for 5 minutes to protect against blood soiling the airways, and 20cc of iced saline was instilled through the blocker to promote hemostasis. The balloon was released again, and bleeding was noted to have stopped. One more biopsy was completed in the segment for a total of 3. Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed. \n \nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.  \n \nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube. A 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement. The needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place. A guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn. A 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated. The 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy.

Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 60% obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass at area of known broncholith. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Gentle pressure was applied to the lesion with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with suction. This resulted in about 90% opening of the bronchus intermedius. There was some brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical ice saline and balloon tamponade. A small residual area of broncholith was seen and was extracted with flexible forceps.

The patient acknowledged and provided consent.  \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After receiving analgesia and paralytics, the patient was mask-bagged and once preoxygenated, an 8.0 endotracheal tube was inserted bronchoscopically using an Olympus T180 therapeutic bronchoscope with an Arent enbobronchial blocker attached to the bronchoscope externally. The blocker was then advanced into the right lower lobe, and the endotracheal tube was advanced over the bronchoscope into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator.  \n \nAfter an unremarkable inspection bronchoscopy, the 2.4 mm reusable ERBE cryoprobe was inserted through the past the balloon into the right lower lobe anterior segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached, the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm, and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds. The flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were then removed en-bloc, and the endobronchial blocker balloon was immediately inflated after removal. One specimen was obtained from the cryoprobe, the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted, and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. No blood was noted, and this was repeated for a total of 5 biopsies. \n \nCryobiopsies were then performed in the lateral segment of the right lower lobe using the same technique. After the second biopsy, significant blood was encountered when the balloon was deflated. The balloon was reinflated for 5 minutes to protect against blood soiling the airways, and 20cc of iced saline was instilled through the blocker to promote hemostasis. The balloon was released again, and bleeding was noted to have stopped. One more biopsy was completed in the segment for a total of 3. Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed. \n \nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.  \n \nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube. A 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement. The needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place. A guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn. A 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated. The 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.  \n \nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed. \n \nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc \nComplications: Pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion \n \nAssessment and Plan: \n- Successful lung cryobiopsy complicated by pneumothorax requiring pigtail insertion \n- CXR pending \n- Admit to Internal medicine for chest tube management \n- Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \nCDR Megan Matthews, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology Staff \nPacific Regional Medical Center \nNAME: KELLY MARTINEZ: 19092357923", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_003"}

A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus.

Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.

The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken.

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube.

Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Following rigid intubation the patient developed unexpected hypoxia of unclear etiology although visible chest rise was seen.  Decision was made to extubate and then re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope using closed assisted ventilation.  After re-intubating with a similar technique the mouth was packed and the nose was plugged to avoid leak. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease.

ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice. We attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique. The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe. Gentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter. Once this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None \nRecommendations:  \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met. \n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week. \n \nJeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_011"}

Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 60% obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass at area of known broncholith. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Gentle pressure was applied to the lesion with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with suction. This resulted in about 90% opening of the bronchus intermedius. There was some brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical ice saline and balloon tamponade. A small residual area of broncholith was seen and was extracted with flexible forceps. Argon plasma coagulation was used to cauterize and destroy the oozing, mild residual obstruction from excess tissue at the base of the lesion.

Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nFollowing intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Following rigid intubation the patient developed unexpected hypoxia of unclear etiology although visible chest rise was seen.  Decision was made to extubate and then re-intubated with the rigid bronchoscope using closed assisted ventilation.  After re-intubating with a similar technique the mouth was packed and the nose was plugged to avoid leak. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed.  Gross pooling of blood was visible throughout the trachea however the trachea itself was normal.  The tracheal carina was sharp. All right sided airways were normal although there was some pooling of blood which was easily suctioned.  On the left the proximal left mainstem was normal.  In the mid left mainstem a white vascular polyploid-appearing tumor was present causing complete obstruction.  We’re able to push the flexible bronchoscope past the lesion. Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood. We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The previously placed Y-stent was in appropriate position with thick mucus coating the inner aspect of the stent. The tracheal limb was about 40% obstructed with mucous, the right sided limb was about 60% obstructed and the left sided limb was completely obstructed. The flexible bronchoscope with suction was used to re-canulate the stent and saline instillation was used to thin the adherent mucous to allow for further removal via suction.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the mid trachea. rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. Post stent removal the airways were widely patent. White plaques were seen in the posterior aspect of the right mainstem and left mainstem consistent with post-treatment effects from tumor. At the location of distal edge of the removed stent granulation tissue was seem both in the BI and the left mainstem. Cryotherapy was performed with three 30 second freeze thaw cycles in the areas of granulation. After this further suction was performed of residual mucous from the more distal airways. Once we were confident that the airways were patent and there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed, and the patient turned over to anesthesia who extubated the patient in the OR.  \nComplications: None  \nRecommendations: \n- Transfer to PACU \n- Obtain post procedure CXR \n- Discharge to home once criteria met.  \n \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nPacific Regional Medical Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_006"}

After receiving analgesia and paralytics the patient was bag masked and once preoxygenated a 12 mm rigid tracheoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. Inspection bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Subsequently a Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the superior segment of the lingula. Under fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal. One specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. The patient did develop some minor hemorrhage which resolved after balloon occlusion. It was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.  A total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously. \n·       Patient to PACU \n·       CXR pending \n·       Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \n \n \n·       NAME: DAVID DAVIS·       DOD NUMBER: 285521294\n·       Proceduralist(s): \n·        Jeffery Chastain MD \n·       Assistants:  \n·       Paul Cusmano MD (Fellow) \n·       Brian Tran MD (Fellow) \n·       Procedure NAME: DAVID DAVIS(pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies \n·       CPT code(s): CPT 320098 Thoracotomy, with biopsy(ies) of pleura \n·       Indications: Left sided pleural effusion \n·       Medications: As per anesthesia record \n·       Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. The pleura was had multiple simple appearing adhesions and small whitish plaques were seen along the posterior parietal pleural. The 5mm disposable primary port was then replaced with an 8mm disposable primary port via the same tract and optical cupped biopsy forceps were introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space. After gentle lysis of simple adhesions with the blunt closed forceps, biopsies of the suspicious areas in the parietal pleura posteriorly were performed with rigid cupped forceps and sent for histopathological and microbiological examination with approximately 8 total biopsies taken. There was minimal bleeding associated with the biopsies. After residual bleeding had subsided, a 14 French pigtail catheter was inserted through the port site and attached to pleuro-vac with suction. After air evacuation with cessation of bubbling in pleuro-vac the chest tube was removed and the site sutured and dressed.  \n·       Complications: None \n·       The patient tolerated the procedural well. \n·       Post-procedure chest radiograph showed full lung re-expansion with minimal residual pleural effusion.  \n·       Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc \n·       Post Procedure Diagnosis: Pleural effusion  \n·       Recommendation: \n·       Discharge once post-op criteria met \n·       Will await pathology and microbiological studies", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_013"}

We then attempted to remove the mass using a electrocautery snare however the base was unexpectedly broad and there could not be lassoed around the tumor.  We then utilized Electrocautery knife and argon plasma coagulation to remove large portions of the tumor which were then extracted with forceps and placed in formalin for analysis. The mass bled easily and topical TXA was used to control the bleeding. We then utilized noncontract APC electrocautery to devascularized the superficial aspects of the tumor and then utilizing the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope and an apple coring technique dissected the remaining large portion of tumor off of the airway wall.  At this point bleeding seemed to be relatively well controlled and we used the cryotherapy probe to remove larger pieces of residual tumor.  We then utilized the flexible bronchoscope to remove large distal clots from the lingula and left lower lobe which were both widely patent.  The left upper lobe proper however remained mostly obstructed with the tumor from the left mainstem extending into the orifice and distally.  We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. At completion of the procedure the left mainstem was >90% patent, the left lower lobe was >90% patent, the lingual was 70% patent, and the left upper lobe proper was 10% patent with residual endobronchial tumor.  \n \nOf note postoperatively the patient was unresponsive and a stroke code was called.  Further documentation is available in the chart however CT of the head and CT angiogram did not show any evidence of stroke and after about an hour and a half the patient spontaneously woke and was oriented x4.  Etiology of the event is not completely clear however likely related to residual effect of anesthesia. \n \nComplications: \nPost-operative encephalopathy  \n \n All right sided airways were normal.

Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The previously placed Y-stent was in appropriate position with thick mucus coating the inner aspect of the stent. The tracheal limb was about 40% obstructed with mucous, the right sided limb was about 60% obstructed and the left sided limb was completely obstructed. The flexible bronchoscope with suction was used to re-canulate the stent and saline instillation was used to thin the adherent mucous to allow for further removal via suction.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the mid trachea. rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. Post stent removal the airways were widely patent. White plaques were seen in the posterior aspect of the right mainstem and left mainstem consistent with post-treatment effects from tumor. At the location of distal edge of the removed stent granulation tissue was seem both in the BI and the left mainstem. Cryotherapy was performed with three 30 second freeze thaw cycles in the areas of granulation. After this further suction was performed of residual mucous from the more distal airways.

Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed, and an LMA was inserted, and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n·       Transfer to PACU \n·       Obtain post-procedure chest x-ray. \n·       Patient to be admitted to inpatient service for expedited radiation oncology consultation, given residual disease. \n·       Patient will need TID hypertonic nebulization (4cc 3% saline) to avoid mucus impaction and obstruction of stent. \n·       Management of stent-related complications was discussed with the in-patient team, and a notice for airway management precautions was placed above the patient's bed. \n·       Plan to schedule the procedure in approximately 2 weeks (after the effects of radiation should be seen). \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nHorizon University Medical Center", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_005"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency.

Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue.

The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty. The stent was well seated with the proximal limb approximately XXX cm distal to the vocal cords and the airway was 100% patent. The bronchoscope was subsequently removed, and the procedure completed. \n \nRecommendations: \n \n- Transfer PACU \n \n- D/C home when criteria met \n \n- Will discuss surgical planning with otolaryngology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_009"}

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal fold on the left was slightly edematous but the cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal.  The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. There was significant distortion of the right sided airways with approximately 60% obstruction from external compression (seen on CT and known to be due to “pinching” from the spine and pulmonary artery). Right sided bronchial mucosa was otherwise normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions.  No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. On the left the proximal mainstem appeared normal. At the distal main stem tumor completely obstructing the right upper lobe and causing about 90% obstruction of the left lower lobe with some degree of submucosal infiltration seen at the LC1 carina. We did not attempt to pass the obstruction. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 11Rs, 4R, 7 and 8 (visible from the left mainstem posteriorly) lymph nodes.  Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 11Rs Lymph node, using an Olympus Visioshot EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. Sampling continued in a systematic fashion from the N3àN2 lymph nodes. The station 8 had features highly concerning for malignancy (round hypoechoic, sharp boarders) and initial sampling was read as non-diagnostic by ROSE, to better sample the node mini-forceps were inserted through the puncture hole from TBNA and into the lymph node with ultrasound visualization and forceps biopsy was obtained. This was performed 3 times.  There was direct tumor invasion of the N1 lymph node (11L) and it was not specifically sampled. ROSE did not show clear evidence of malignancy of nodal sampling. We then used the EBUS scope to visualize the 4cm mass adjacent to the left mainstem bronchi and were able to access it with the EBUS TBNA needle. Preliminary ROSE was consistent with malignancy.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease. No evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes. ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice. We attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique. The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe. Gentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter. Once this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None \nRecommendations:  \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met. \n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week. \n \nJeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_011"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.  The excised 15x50mm silicone stent was cleaned and loaded into the Efer-dumon stent loading system and deployed through the rigid bronchoscope into the previous location without difficulty.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease. No evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes. ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice. We attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique. The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe. Gentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter. Once this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None \nRecommendations:  \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met. \n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week. \n \nJeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_011"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the T190 therapeutic video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The previously placed Y-stent was in appropriate position with thick mucus coating the inner aspect of the stent. The tracheal limb was about 40% obstructed with mucous, the right sided limb was about 60% obstructed and the left sided limb was completely obstructed. The flexible bronchoscope with suction was used to re-canulate the stent and saline instillation was used to thin the adherent mucous to allow for further removal via suction.  The flexible bronchoscope and LMA were then removed, and a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the mid trachea. rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. Post stent removal the airways were widely patent. White plaques were seen in the posterior aspect of the right mainstem and left mainstem consistent with post-treatment effects from tumor. At the location of distal edge of the removed stent granulation tissue was seem both in the BI and the left mainstem. Cryotherapy was performed with three 30 second freeze thaw cycles in the areas of granulation. After this further suction was performed of residual mucous from the more distal airways. Once we were confident that the airways were patent and there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed, and the patient turned over to anesthesia who extubated the patient in the OR.  \nComplications: None  \nRecommendations: \n- Transfer to PACU \n- Obtain post procedure CXR \n- Discharge to home once criteria met.  \n \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nNaval Medical Center San Diego", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_006"}

After receiving analgesia and paralytics the patient was bag masked and once preoxygenated a 12 mm rigid tracheoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. Inspection bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Subsequently a Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the superior segment of the lingula. Under fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal. One specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. The patient did develop some minor hemorrhage which resolved after balloon occlusion. It was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.  A total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously. \n·       Patient to PACU \n·       CXR pending \n·       Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \n \n \n·       NAME: PATRICK ANDERSON·       DOD NUMBER: 25118987940\n·       Proceduralist(s): \n·        Jeffery Chastain MD \n·       Assistants:  \n·       Paul Cusmano MD (Fellow) \n·       Brian Tran MD (Fellow) \n·       Procedure NAME: PATRICK ANDERSON(pleuroscopy) with parietal pleural biopsies \n·       CPT code(s): CPT 320098 Thoracotomy, with biopsy(ies) of pleura \n·       Indications: Left sided pleural effusion \n·       Medications: As per anesthesia record \n·       Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. The patient was placed on the standard procedural bed in the right lateral decubitus position and sites of compression were well padded. The pleural entry site was identified by means of the ultrasound. The patient was sterilely prepped with chlorhexidine gluconate (Chloraprep) and draped in the usual fashion. The entry sites was infiltrated with a 10mL solution of 1% lidocaine. Following instillation of subcutaneous lidocaine a 1.5 cm subcutaneous incision was made and gentle dissection was performed until the pleural space was entered.  A 5 mm disposable primary port was then placed on the left side at the 6th anterior axillary line. After allowing air entrainment and lung deflation, suction was applied through the port to remove pleural fluid with removal of approximately 700cc of serosanguinous fluid. The rigid pleuroscopy telescope was then introduced through the trocar and advanced into the pleural space.

The patient acknowledged and provided consent.  \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After receiving analgesia and paralytics, the patient was mask-bagged and once preoxygenated, an 8.0 endotracheal tube was inserted bronchoscopically using an Olympus T180 therapeutic bronchoscope with an Arent enbobronchial blocker attached to the bronchoscope externally. The blocker was then advanced into the right lower lobe, and the endotracheal tube was advanced over the bronchoscope into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator.  \n \nAfter an unremarkable inspection bronchoscopy, the 2.4 mm reusable ERBE cryoprobe was inserted through the past the balloon into the right lower lobe anterior segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached, the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm, and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds. The flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were then removed en-bloc, and the endobronchial blocker balloon was immediately inflated after removal. One specimen was obtained from the cryoprobe, the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted, and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. No blood was noted, and this was repeated for a total of 5 biopsies. \n \nCryobiopsies were then performed in the lateral segment of the right lower lobe using the same technique. After the second biopsy, significant blood was encountered when the balloon was deflated. The balloon was reinflated for 5 minutes to protect against blood soiling the airways, and 20cc of iced saline was instilled through the blocker to promote hemostasis. The balloon was released again, and bleeding was noted to have stopped. One more biopsy was completed in the segment for a total of 3. Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed. \n \nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.  \n \nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube. A 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement. The needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place. A guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn. A 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated. The 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.  \n \nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed. \n \nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc \nComplications: Pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion \n \nAssessment and Plan: \n- Successful lung cryobiopsy complicated by pneumothorax requiring pigtail insertion \n- CXR pending \n- Admit to Internal medicine for chest tube management \n- Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \nCDR Jessica Hernandez, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology Staff \nNaval Medical Center San Diego \nNAME: WILLIAM MILLER: 19092357923", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_003"}

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease. No evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes. ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice. We attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique. The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe. Gentile dilatation was performed within the segments resulting in significant improvement in diameter. Once this was completed, we inspected the airway for evidence of bleeding and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted while awaiting emergence and the procedure was completed.  \nComplications: None \nRecommendations:  \n- Transfer to PACU then home once criteria are met. \n- Wil follow-up in pulm clinic for re-evaluation and repeat CT in 1 week. \n \nJeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology.", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "note_011"}
