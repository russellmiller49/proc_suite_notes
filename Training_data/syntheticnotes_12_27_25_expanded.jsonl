Following intravenous medications as per the record a 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth into the distal trachea and advanced into the distal trachea before attaching the monsoon JET ventilator. Using the flexible bronchoscope airway inspection was performed. The tracheal carina was sharp. All left sided airways were normal. The right mainstem and right upper lobe were normal. In the proximal bronchus intermedius there was a 60% obstructing polypoid endobronchial mass at area of known broncholith. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem. Gentle pressure was applied to the lesion with the flexible bronchoscopy allowing the broncholith to be extracted from the airway wall and then removed with suction. This resulted in about 90% opening of the bronchus intermedius. There was some brisk bleeding which was controlled with topical ice saline and balloon tamponade. A small residual area of broncholith was seen and was extracted with flexible forceps.

The patient acknowledged and provided consent.  \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After receiving analgesia and paralytics, the patient was mask-bagged and once preoxygenated, an 8.0 endotracheal tube was inserted bronchoscopically using an Olympus T180 therapeutic bronchoscope with an Arent enbobronchial blocker attached to the bronchoscope externally. The blocker was then advanced into the right lower lobe, and the endotracheal tube was advanced over the bronchoscope into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator.  \n \nAfter an unremarkable inspection bronchoscopy, the 2.4 mm reusable ERBE cryoprobe was inserted through the past the balloon into the right lower lobe anterior segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached, the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm, and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds. The flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were then removed en-bloc, and the endobronchial blocker balloon was immediately inflated after removal. One specimen was obtained from the cryoprobe, the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted, and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. No blood was noted, and this was repeated for a total of 5 biopsies. \n \nCryobiopsies were then performed in the lateral segment of the right lower lobe using the same technique. After the second biopsy, significant blood was encountered when the balloon was deflated. The balloon was reinflated for 5 minutes to protect against blood soiling the airways, and 20cc of iced saline was instilled through the blocker to promote hemostasis. The balloon was released again, and bleeding was noted to have stopped. One more biopsy was completed in the segment for a total of 3. Once it was confirmed that there was no active bleeding, the flexible bronchoscope was removed. \n \nFollowing the completion of the procedure, fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to assess for pneumothorax, and a moderate right-sided pneumothorax was visualized.  \n \nThe right lateral chest wall was marked, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1% Lidocaine was used to anesthetize the skin down to the rib and along the proposed insertion path for the tube. A 20-gauge Yueh-centesis needle with a syringe attached was inserted into the pleural space under fluoroscopic visualization, with aspiration of air to verify placement. The needle was then removed, and the catheter was left in place. A guide wire was advanced into the pleural space through the catheter, and the catheter was then withdrawn. A 0.5cm incision was made through the skin, and the subcutaneous tissues were dilated. The 14Fr Wayne pigtail chest drain was inserted into the pleural space. The drain was immediately connected to a Pleur-evac. Adequate placement was confirmed by air leak and fluoroscopy. The tube was sutured in place, and a dressing was applied.  \n \nAt this point, the endotracheal tube was removed, and the procedure was completed. \n \nEstimated Blood Loss: 10cc \nComplications: Pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion \n \nAssessment and Plan: \n- Successful lung cryobiopsy complicated by pneumothorax requiring pigtail insertion \n- CXR pending \n- Admit to Internal medicine for chest tube management \n- Await pathological evaluation of tissue \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain, MD \nInterventional Pulmonology Staff \nNaval Medical Center San Diego \nName: James Feller DoD ID: 19092357923", "synthetic": false, "source_note_id": "Syntheticnotes_12_27_25.txt"}

All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedural assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb, and 35mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right-sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem, and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways, resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally, with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus.

Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed before the intervention. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was carried out in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record, a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure adequate ventilation. Topical anesthesia was applied to the upper airway, and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway, and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in a good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid-trachea was free of tumor, but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect, with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway, causing approximately 70% obstruction. A few small tumor nodules were present in the distal trachea, mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally, with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem, there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of the known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue, the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucus throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions, and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive pus was noted distal to the stent, primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus, and a mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe, however, appeared free of disease. \n \nAt this point, the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed, and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus, then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed, and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge of the stent. APC was used, followed by gentle shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We then utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this, a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided similarly outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. We repeated this multiple times, attempting to slowly recannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa, and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction, both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compression, was still present. At this point, we focused on the right-sided airway and utilized APC with the burn and shave technique, attempting to recannulate the airway with partial success; however, obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem, with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. \n \nMeasurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement.

All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the preprocedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. \nSedation: General Anesthesia \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Once the patient was sedated and paralyzed a 12 mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was inserted through the mouth into the sub-glottic space. A flexible T190 Olympus bronchoscope was inserted through the tracheoscope into the trachea and thick mucus and bloody secretions were suctioned from the stent. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and the rigid non-optical forceps were inserted through the rigid scope along with the rigid optic. The forceps were used to grasp the proximal limb of the tracheal stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid bronchoscope.  The stent was subsequently removed en-bloc with the rigid bronchoscope without difficulty.  Once his stent was removed a laryngeal mask airway was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was then inserted through the LMA for re-inspection. The trachea mucosa was friable and inflamed but without residual obstruction. The right mainstem and distal airways were normal. The left mainstem was normal however a small fractures piece of the stent was found within the left mainstem which was removed with flexible forceps without difficulty. The left sided airways were re-inspected and normal without any other residual fractured stent pieces. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was subsequently removed and the procedure completed. Post-procedure, the patient developed laryngospasm requiring intubation by anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope was then inserted into the posterior oropharynx and 6cc of topical 1% lidocaine was injected onto the vocal cords prior to extubation after which the patient was able to adequately ventilate prior to transfer to the PACU.  \nComplications: Post-procedure laryngospasm requiring re-intubation.  \nRecommendations: \n- Transfer PACU \n- Obtain post procedure CXR \n- Discharge to home once criteria met.  \n \n \nCDR Jeffery Chastain MD \nInterventional Pulmonology \nNaval Medical Center San Diego", "synthetic": true, "source_note_id": "syntheticnotes_12_27_25_orig_007"}

Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time.

At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.

The patient acknowledged and gave consent. \n \nSedation: General Anesthesia \n \nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in OR 23. Following intravenous medications as per the record the ventilator was attached to the patients t-tube and an laryngeal mask airway was inserted. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The supraglottic space was edematous. Granulation tissue was seen at the level of the vocal cords causing complete obstruction and inability to visualize the proximal aspect of the t-tube. The T190 bronchoscope was removed and the P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was inserted in a similar fashion. By applying gentle tressure we were able to advance the bronchoscope through the granulation tissue and into the t-tube. Thich dry secretions were visualized within the t-tube and were removed with a combination of suction, cryotherapy and flexible forceps. To improve patency. Once past the T-tube Moderate amount of secretions were seen in the trachea and proximal bronchi bilaterally and were suctioned clear. The distal tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The flexible bronchoscope was removed and inserted through the external limb of the t-tube and thick secretions were removed in a similar fashion using suction, cryotherapy and forceps. The bronchoscope was then reinserted through the LMA. The neck was cleaned with chlorhexidine and a guidewire was inserted into the t-tube. Using gentle tugging the t-tube was removed leaving the guidewire in-place. At this point a blue rhino dilator and guide sheath was inserted over the wire using a Seldinger technique to dilate the stoma. The dilator was removed and a 6.0 uncuffed Shiley tracheostomy was inserted with the blue rhino introducer into the airway. The guidewire, introducer sheath and introducer catheter were then removed leaving the tracheostomy tube in place. The bronchoscope was then inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm position.  \nAt this point the therapeutic bronchoscope was introduced through the LMA and using APC we attempted to debulk the subglottic granulation tissue. We were not able to easy remove enough tissue to visualize the tracheostomy tube and the decision was made to not undergo further attempts at this time. The bronchoscope was removed, and the procedure competed.  \n \n. Approximately XXX cm below the vocal cords the previously placed silicone tube stent was visualized. There was mild granulation tissue at the proximal end which was non-obstructive. The stent was widely patent and clear of debris. . At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently inserted into the upper trachea. Dual action rigid forceps were used to grasp the proximal end of the stent and were rotated repeatedly while withdrawing the stent into the rigid tracheoscope. The stent could not be easily withdrawn through the lumen of the scope and the rigid bronchoscope was removed en-bloc with the stent which was then removed from the lumen. An LMA was re-inserted and the flexible bronchoscope inserted into the subglottic space. The exposed mucosa in the area of the previous stent was evaluated. The mucosa was irritated and friable for the extent of the stent. The A-shaped stenosis was noted causing approximately 30% obstruction and was measured at 1.5cm in length, The distance from the vocal cords to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 4.5 cm and the distance from the cricoid cartilage to the proximal edge of the stenosis was 3 cm. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 14mm non-ventilating rigid tracheoscope was subsequently re-inserted into the upper trachea.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue. We could not bypass the obstruction with the diagnostic bronchoscope. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The EBUS bronchoscope was first used to inspect the level of the 10L lymph node due to radiographic suspicion for disease. No evidence of adenopathy was seen. We then evaluated the sation 7 lymph node due to radiographic concerns. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle for a total of 4 passes. ROSE did not show evidence suspicious for malignancy. The EBUS bronchoscope was removed and an 11 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. We then inserted therapeutic T190 flexible bronchoscope into the airway and advanced to the left upper lobe orifice. We attempted to gently dilate the orifice using a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion but were unable to clearly define branching segments and aborted we then dilated the orifice of the left lower lobe starting with a 6-7-8 CRE balloon in sequential fashion before converting to an 8.9.10 balloon also dilating with a similar technique. The orifice post dilatation was approximately 70% open. We then were able to advance the therapeutic bronchoscope into the left lower lobe. Segmental stricturing was seen in the superior segment and the medial basal segment if the left lower lobe.

After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The right sided tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal. No evidence of endobronchial disease was seen to at least the first sub-segments. The proximal left mainstem was normal The left upper lobe was essentially completely closed due to what appeared to be scan and granulation tissue while the left lower lobe was approximately 80% obstructed due to mostly anatomical distortion as well as some degree related to granulation tissue.

Flexible bronchoscopy with therapeutic aspiration 2. Endobronchial glue installation 3. Chest tube insertion.  Indications for the procedure: Prolonged chest tube airleak  Anesthesia: General anesthesia  Procedure: Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs  Following intravenous medications as per the record the patient was intubated with an 8.0 ETT by anesthesia. The T190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via ETT and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first sub-segmental level. The left sided airways were normal. There was mild to moderate thick secretions in the right basilar segments. Within the right upper lobe the previously placed endobronchchial valves were visualized. The apical and anterior segment size 7 endobronchial valves appeared well placed with with some surrounding mucus. The posterior size 6 valve appeared to have migrated somewhat distally and was slightly mispositioned. The chest tube was noted to not be titling and no air leak could be found despite gentle oxygen insufflation through the bronchoscope. At this point the chest tube was felt to be obstructed and was replaced over guidewire with a new 14 French Wayne pneumothorax tube with development of leak. At this point we switched to a Boston Scientific disposable bronchoscope inserted into the right upper lobe and the vena-seal saline delivery system catheter was advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope and approximately 2 cc of bleeding was applied to seal the fistula. Following this 5 cc of the patient's blood was aspirated from central venous catheter and instilled through the bronchoscope into the right upper lobe to activate adhesive glue. Secretions were then aspirated from the bronchus intermedius and lower lobe and the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. There is initially a resolution of air leak with present tideling in the atrium however after completion of the procedure air leak returned. At this point the hope is that once the glue settles the leak will resolve however will need away to determine if procedure was successful.

Thick coagulated old blood was noted to fill the airways distally to the obstructing mass.  We then advanced the rigid bronchoscope into the left mainstem to protect the right side from potential spillover of blood.

We were able to remove small pieces of tumor which were sent for pathological evaluation but were unable to adequately relieve the obstruction and felt the potential benefit of further debulking likely would be low given that surgical lobectomy is likely in the patient's future.  At this point we used APC to coagulate the remaining areas of oozing and once we are satisfied the rigid bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed.
