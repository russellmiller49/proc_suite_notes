INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [Redacted]  is a 62 year old-year-old female who presents with Complicated Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Thoracoscopy with biopsy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Complicated Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32609 Thoracoscopy; with biopsy(ies) of pleura
32653 Thoracoscopy, surgical; with removal of intrapleural foreign body or fibrin deposit
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required) - there was extensive small loculate adhesions that required increased time and expertise to removed and uncover the thickened pleural. Total time with lysis of adhesions was approximately 2 hours.
