PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
 images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The tracheostomy tube is in good position. The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Airway exam notable for mild amount of bloody secretions throughout the right sided airways with mild mucosal injury from scope trauma at the distal BI. The left airways show stent well seated in the mid LMSB with distal end still in LLL truncus basalis. Moderate bloody secretions in the LLL. 
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), and LLL from mucus, blood, and blood clots. 
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Anteromedial Segment of LLL (Lb7/8).  Instilled 80 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.
