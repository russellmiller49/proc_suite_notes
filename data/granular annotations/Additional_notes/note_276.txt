San Diego,  CA [REDACTED]
 
INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old female who presents with COPD for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: J44.9 COPD
 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  J44.9 COPD
 
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31624 Dx bronchoscope/lavage (BAL)    
31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance 
31647 Bronchial valve insert initial lobe 
31651 Bronchial valve insert additional lobe
 
22 Substantially greater work than normal (i.e., increased intensity, time, technical difficulty of procedure, and severity of patient's condition, physical and mental effort required)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required endobronchial valve placement in multiple lobes. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31634 Balloon occlusion or placement of occlusive substance 
31647 Bronchial valve insert initial lobe 
31651 Bronchial valve insert additional lobe.

ASSISTANT:   Brian Tran MD
 
Support Staff: 
RN: Maribel Dean
RT: Maria Aries
 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).  All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart. 
 
PATIENT POSITION: Supine
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
The endotracheal tube is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Larynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through ETT.
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
 
Balloon Occlusion was performed to confirm lobe selection.
‌ YES

Chartis System was used to confirm no collateral ventilation 
‌ YES
 
Airleak stop or reduced was confirmed
‌ YES
 
The following lobes were intervened:
‌ Right Upper 
‌ Right Middle 

 
The following valve were used:
‌ Spiration (Olympus)
‌ Zephyr (Pulmonx)
 
Valve sizes used and corresponding segments below:
 

Airway	Valve
RUL apical and posterior subsegments (RB1 and RB3)	Zephyr size 5.5
RUL anterior subsegment (RB2)	Zephyr size 5.5
RML medial subsegment	Spiration size 9
RML lateral subsegment	Spiration size 7
 
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Medial-basal Segment of RLL (RB7).  Instilled 60 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--RLL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 57 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for placement of endobronchial valves for lung volume reduction. Patient had Zephyr valves placed at the RUL and Spiration valves placed in the RML. She tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.
 
--Post procedure CXR
--Follow up BAL results
--Hospital admission for observation/PTX watch
