INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 80 year old-year-old male who presents with Recurrent Effusion.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Tunnel Pleural Catheter Placement were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate. The patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form / provided consent over the phone. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Recurrent Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32550 Insertion of indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with cuff
 
Mod 62 Co-surgeons performing separate parts of the procedure

 
SEDATION: MAC per Anesthesia

 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.

PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A guidewire was inserted through the pleuroscopy insertion site (see separate documentation for pleuroscopy).  A 5mm skin incision was made approximately 5 cm away from the guidewire insertion site.  The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue.  The introducer sheath was placed and the guidewire removed.  The catheter was then placed into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with an absorbable suture.  The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon.  Sterile dressings were applied.
