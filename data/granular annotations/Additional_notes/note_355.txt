INDICATION FOR OPERATION: [REDACTED]is a 85 year old male who presents with Pleural Effusion.  
 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. The nature, indications, purpose, benefits, risks, potential complications, and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis were discussed with the patient or surrogate decision-maker in detail.  Patient or surrogate decision-maker agreed to proceed with procedure.  The patient or surrogate decision-maker read and signed the provided consent form or provided consent over the phone. If consent was provided over the phone, then the consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional.
 
All procedure related images were saved and archived in Media folder on Onedrive behind UCSD firewall, relevant images are also uploaded to PACS system or in the media section of the patient's chart.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pleural Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32555 Aspirate pleura with imaging (thoracentesis)
 
50 Bilateral Procedures (Procedure done on both sides of the body) and 59 Similar to 51 but for uncommonly combined procedures. Can be used if a diagnostic procedure is performed which provides information which leads to a therapeutic procedure (XE/XS/XP/XU)
 
IP UCSD CODE MOD DETAILS: Unusual Procedure (50 MODIFIER):
This patient required a bilateral procedure today when this procedure would typically be unilateral. Apply to:
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
 
59 MODIFIER:
This thoracentesis procedure was performed in addition to the bronchoscopy procedure.  These are separate and uncommonly combined procedures.  This thoracentesis was performed in the pre-operative area.  The patient was then taken to a different location (the operative area) and underwent bronchoscopy procedure  please see separate documentation for that procedure.
 
Local Anesthesia (Lidocaine)
 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
PROCEDURE(S) IN DETAIL:
A timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, MRN, DOB, procedure type, and procedure location).
 
PATIENT POSITION:  Sitting
 
LEFT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE:
FINDINGS:
Hemithorax:  LEFT
Pleural Effusion: 
Volume:  Small
Echogenicity:  Anechoic
Loculations:  None
Diaphragmatic Motion:  Normal
Lung: 
Lung sliding before procedure:  Present
Lung sliding post procedure:  See other ultrasound exam below
Lung consolidation/atelectasis:  Present - very minimal at lung base consistent with atelectasis
Pleura:  Normal
Image(s) saved and uploaded:  YES - saved to Media tab
 
RIGHT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE:
FINDINGS:
Hemithorax:  RIGHT
Pleural Effusion: 
Volume:  Tiny - not amenable to thoracentesis
Echogenicity:  Anechoic
Loculations:  None
Diaphragmatic Motion:  Normal
Lung: 
Lung sliding before procedure:  Present
Lung sliding post procedure:  N/A
Lung consolidation/atelectasis:  Present - tiny at lung base, consistent with atelectasis.
Pleura:  Normal
Image(s) saved and uploaded:  YES - saved to Media tab
 
LEFT THORACENTESIS PROCEDURE:
Anatomic landmarks and ultrasound-guidance were utilized to determine the appropriate insertion site.  Insertion site marked.  Thoracentesis Kit was used. 
 
ANESTHESIA:   Lidocaine 1%: 10 mL      Other:  
 
Entry Site: LEFT 7th Intercostal Space in the Mid-scapular line
 
Procedure was performed using sterile technique throughout.  Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was used to anesthesize the skin, subcutaneous tissue, superior aspect of the inferior rib periosteum and parietal pleura. A #10 scalpel blade was used to nick the skin at the insertion site.  A Cook 5Fr Yueh over-the-needle catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. The needle and over-the-needle catheter were introduced through the skin incision into the pleural space while applying negative aspiration pressure.  Entry into pleural space was confirmed by aspiration of light yellow-colored fluid.  While holding the insertion needle stable, the catheter was then threaded into the pleural space without difficulty.  The insertion needle was removed.  Pleural fluid was aspirated through the catheter via manual aspiration without difficulty - see fluid description and aspirated volume below.  The catheter was then removed while patient exhaled.  Pressure briefly held until minimal bleeding stopped and bandage applied over site.
 
Fluid Description:  Light yellow Serous
Fluid Volume Removed: 250 ml 
 
Drainage method:   Manual aspiration into drainage bag.
Pleural pressures:   Not measured.
 
Reason pleural fluid aspiration was stopped:  Unable to manually aspirate any further fluid.
 
Post-procedure Chest Ultrasound (after thoracentesis catheter removed) showed: 
LEFT CHEST ULTRASOUND PROCEDURE:

?Analyses - TProt, LDH, Glucose, and Cholesterol
?Cell Count
?Cultures - Gram Stain/Bacterial Culture, Blood culture bottle bedside innoculation, AFB, and Fungal
?Cytology  

 
CXR ordered: yes
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  <5 mL
COMPLICATIONS:  None.  There were no immediate complications.
 
IMPRESSION/PLAN:[REDACTED]is a 85 year old-year-old male who presents for Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  
 
DISPOSITION: To remain in same location - same level of care
 
Follow-up pleural fluid studies.
To proceed with robotic navigational bronchoscopy procedure next.
