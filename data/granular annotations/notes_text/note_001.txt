PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula s/p Ivor Lewis Esophagostomy 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula s/p Ivor Lewis Esophagostomy  s/p occlusive left mainstem stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible, self-expandable airway stent placement
INDICATIONS: broncho-esophageal(anastomosis) fistula with persistent leak despite esophageal stent
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives a flexible bronchoscope was passed through the patients tracheostomy tube and into the airways. The trachea was normal. Purulent secretions were seen throughout the airways. Once secretions were suctioned inspection of the right sided airways should multiple small endobronchial nodular lesions concerning for airway metastasis. On the left in the mid left mainstem a 1.5cm fistula was seen at the medial aspect of the posterior wall. Distally (similar to what was seen on the right) were multiple small endobronchial lesions with an appearance suggestive of malignancy. Multiple nodules from the left and right side were biopsied with flexible forceps and placed in formalin.  At this point we measured the length of the fistula and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope past the fistula within the left mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the selected area required to cover the fistula with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 14x30 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation.  The stent was deployed slightly too proximally with the distal edge just covering the fistula. We then decided to place a second 14x40 Aero stent into the previously place stent to better cover the obstruction. This was done in a similar fashion. On inspection after placement the originally placed stent was noted to have been pushed distally by the second stent (more distal than desired and obstructing the orifice of the left upper and lower lobe. We then removed the 14x40 stent by grasping the proximal edge with forceps. The stent could not be retracted through the tracheostomy so the trach tube was removed and then the stent was pulled through the stoma, after which re re-inserted the trach over a bronchoscope and re-attached it to the ventilator. We then retraced the remaining 14x30 mm Aero fully covered self-expandable metallic stent into proper position (within the left mainstem covering the fistula) with forceps. Once this was done and we were satisfied with the final result the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. We then turned the patient over to anesthesia service to recover and transfer back to the ICU.
Post procedure diagnosis:
Recommendations:
- Transfer back to ICU
- Await tissue diagnosis from biopsied endobronchial nodules
- Obtain post procedure CXR
- TID saline nebulizers along with ensuring oxygen is humidified to avoid mucous impaction and obstruction of stent.
