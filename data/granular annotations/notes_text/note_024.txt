NOTE_ID:  note_024 SOURCE_FILE: note_024.txt PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with BAL and TBBX under moderate sedation
INDICATION : Lung Transplant 
CONSENT : Obtained before the procedure. Its indications and potential complications and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The patient read and signed the provided consent form. The consent was witnessed by an assisting medical proffesional.
 
MONITORING : Continuous telemetry, BP and oxygen saturation monitored
INSTRUMENT : Olympus Video Bronchoscope
ANESTHESIA : Moderate IV sedation with: fentanyl 50 mcg and Versed 2 mg; Local anesthesia with: Lidocaine 2% Solution ~8ml via adomizer
Sedation time was 15 min during this procedure
 
 
Time out: Immediately prior to procedure a "time out" was called to verify the correct patient, procedure, equipment, support staff and site/side  marked as required.  
 
SUMMARY : Initially a time-out was performed prior to the procedure, confirming the patient's name, procedure type and procedure location. After the patient was properly positioned and sedated and topical anesthesia applied, the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth with O2 being administered at all times. This was done without difficulty. The bronchoscope was passed by the carina, which was examined for sharpness, position and texture. The bronchial orifices were systematically identified, evaluated and suctioned free of secretions and close attention was paid to color, texture, positions, size and patency.
