IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure:
This patient required multiple modalities and increased effort to access and open the RML. This resulted in >100% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required. Apply to: 31629 TBNA single lobe   
31652 EBUS sampling 1 or 2 nodes
31630 Balloon dilation
31640 Bronchoscopy with excision . 
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope
Flexible Hybrid (Pedatric) Bronchoscope
Linear EBUS 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Moderate
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
  
The laryngeal mask airway is in good position.
Pharynx: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Larynx: Not fully assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through LMA.
Vocal Cords: Normal without mass/lesions
Trachea: Distal 1/3 normal.
Main Carina: Sharp
Right Lung Proximal Airways: RML orifice unable to be identified on initial inspection since the airway had swallowed up the prior RML stent and this was now fused shut. No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Left Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level.  No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other endobronchial pathology.
Mucosa: Normal.
Secretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.  
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.

PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED]
 
PRIOR VIEW OF RML AND RLL FROM PRIOR BRONCHOSCOPY [REDACTED] 
The RML was unable to be identified and there was suspicion that the RML stent migrated distally with overgrowth of tissue, effectively closing off the RML. The EBUS scope was utilized to identify the RML orifice and distal stent. Transbronchial needle aspiration was utilized to re-create/re-open the RML orifice. During this maneuver, frank pus was aspirated from the RML.
RML stent with needle within the airway:
 
Once an pinhole opening was made with above TBNA, pulmonary forceps were used to probe the RML and blunt dissect to widen the opening.
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at RML.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
A 4Fr Fogarty balloon was inserted to further open the RML.  
Purulent secretions distal to the obstruction were aspirated. 
The hybrid scope was used to explore the distal RML and the medial and lateral subsegments were successfully identified.
Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at Lateral Segment of RML (RB4) and Medial Segment of RML (RB5).  Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 25 cc of NS.  Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2).  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
After above excision and dilation, the RML was finally patent and the stent could be visualized. 
VIEW OF RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
VIEW OF DISTAL RML AFTER RECANNALIZATION
 
The foreign body/old stent (iCAST 7mm x 16mm) was identified and grasped with the pulmonary rat tooth forceps. This was removed en bloc with the bronchoscope.
Bleeding/oozing was noted from the RML and this was treated with multiple modalities including cold saline, TXA, epinephrine, and electrocautery/coagulation.
Endobronchial debris and hemorrhage at RML was treated with the following modalities:
Modality	Tools	Setting/Mode	Duration	Results
Electrocautery	Probe 	Forced coag	2-5sec	Ablation/Coagulation
 
In effort to prevent stent from getting swallowed up again, a longer stent was selected. Next, an iCAST 7mm x 22mm stent was deployed into the RML however this blocked off the RLL and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
An iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML but was noted to be too proximal and was subsequently removed en bloc with the bronchoscope using the rat tooth forceps.
Another iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML and seated appropriately. 
Balloon dilation was performed at RML Carina (RC2) through the stent to seat the stent.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the RML Carina (RC2).  Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds.
RML stent at end of case:
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
--iCAST 7mm x 16mm stent (path)
--RML BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 57 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. The patient's RML was closed off around his iCAST stent. The RML was reopened and the stent was removed. A new iCAST stent (7mm x 16mm) was placed. Patient tolerated the procedure and there were no immediate complications.
--Follow-up path and BAL results
--Repeat bronchoscopy in 2 weeks for re-evaluation
--Augmentin (875mg-125mg) 1 tab by mouth twice daily for 7 days
