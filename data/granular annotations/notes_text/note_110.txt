The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with procedure and informed consent was signed.
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Pleural Effusion
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same as preoperative diagnosis - see above. 
PROCEDURE:  
76604 Ultrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation
32555 Aspirate pleura with imaging (thoracentesis)
53 Procedure was started, but terminated before completion due to unexpected circumstances or for the patient's well being
Local ONLY
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.

Based on Ultrasound Evaluation: the small effusion was visible in the 2nd intercostal space but without an access point that would avoid the lung. There was a small window for access identified above the clavicle. 
Insertion site prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Thoracentesis Kit was used with 5Fr Yeuh catheter. 
ANESTHESIA:   Lidocaine 1%: __8____ ml      Other: ______ 
Entry Site: 
0‌ Right ___ Intercostal Space   1‌ Left  __1st_ Intercostal Space 
1‌ Mid-clavicular   0‌ Mid-axillary  0‌ Mid-scapular  0‌ Other: 
After advancement of finder needle into the space under real-time US guidance, there was resistance and no fluid was aspirated despite three attempts. As such, procedure aborted 
 
COMPLICATIONS:

IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 56 year old-year-old male who presents for Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis LEFT.  The procedure was aborted as no fluid could be aspirated. 
- consider CT-guided approach, though this also may be challenging unless the effusion grows further
