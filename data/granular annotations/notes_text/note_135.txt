NOTE_ID:  note_135 SOURCE_FILE: note_135.txt Procedure: Bronchoscopy (rigid + flexible)
Indication: Collapsed left lung due to left mainstem airway stent occlusion (stent placed on [REDACTED]).
Anesthesia/Ventilation: General anesthesia with jet ventilation. Topical 2% lidocaine to tracheobronchial tree (2 mL).
Pre-procedure status: ASA III, ECOG 3. Standard consent/time-out performed. Labs/imaging reviewed.
Protocol: Enrolled in protocol 2010-0990 (normal saline vs 4.2% bicarbonate solution for mucus obstruction clearance in airway stent lumen).

Technique

Q180 slim video bronchoscope introduced orally to trachea.

T180 therapeutic video bronchoscope introduced through rigid bronchoscope and advanced through the tracheobronchial tree.

Findings

Larynx: Normal.

Trachea/Carina: No significant pathology.

Right lung: No significant pathology.

Left lung:

Left mainstem bronchus: 14 mm x 4 cm Microvasive stent present. Stent lumen completely obstructed by blood clot and clear retained secretions.

After instillation of 10 cc of “agent A” (per study protocol), clot successfully removed with no significant bleeding and no residual stent lumen obstruction (stent lumen patent).

Left lower lobe: Malignant airway disease with:

>90% near-complete obstruction of segmental bronchi from malignant extrinsic compression and submucosal infiltration.

An additional completely obstructing lesion in the LLL due to malignant disease.

Stent position: Stent covers the left upper lobe takeoff.

Impression

Complete occlusion of left mainstem stent (blood clot + secretions) causing collapsed left lung → successfully cleared, stent patent post-intervention.

Severe malignant obstruction of the left lower lobe (near-complete and complete obstructions), consistent with advanced malignant airway involvement.

No right-sided, tracheal, or carinal pathology identified.

No specimens obtained.

Complications / Blood Loss

No immediate complications.

Estimated blood loss: None.
