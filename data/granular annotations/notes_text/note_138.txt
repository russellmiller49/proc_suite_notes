NOTE_ID:  note_138 SOURCE_FILE: note_138.txt Procedure Name: Bronchoscopy
Indications: Lung mass
Medications: General anesthesia; 2% lidocaine instilled to the tracheobronchial tree (volume per anesthesia record)

Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered, and informed consent was documented per institutional protocol. A history and physical examination were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention. Following administration of intravenous medications per the anesthesia record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the BF-H190 slim video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth via a laryngeal mask airway and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was subsequently introduced in a similar fashion. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Procedure Description:

The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords moved normally with respiration. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber, and the carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal, with no endobronchial lesions and no secretions noted on the left.

A stricture was identified in the right bronchus intermedius involving the right lower lobe bronchus. The narrowing appeared fibrotic, with near-complete occlusion of the airway lumen. The lesion was not traversed.

Findings / EBUS Evaluation:

The bronchoscope was withdrawn and replaced with the EBUS bronchoscope to perform ultrasound examination. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was conducted.

Lymph node sizing was performed via endobronchial ultrasound in the setting of suspected non-small cell lung cancer. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using an Olympus EBUS-TBNA 22-gauge needle targeting a left pulmonary artery mass, with specimens sent for routine cytology.

The left pulmonary artery mass measured 10.1 mm by EBUS and 11 mm by CT. PET imaging was positive.

On ultrasound, the mass was hypoechoic, heterogeneous, irregularly shaped, with sharp margins, and appeared to form part of the pulmonary artery wall.

Flow was noted within the left pulmonary artery and, to a lesser extent, the right pulmonary artery.

The mass was biopsied using a 22-gauge needle. A total of three passes were performed.

Rapid on-site evaluation preliminary assessment was nondiagnostic.

All specimens were sent to cytopathology for review.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: <5 mL

Post-Procedure Diagnosis:

Lymph node sizing and sampling performed

Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies

The patient remained stable throughout the procedure and was transferred in good condition to the post-bronchoscopy recovery area, where he will be observed until discharge criteria are met. Preliminary findings were discussed with the patient, and follow-up with the requesting service for final pathology results has been recommended.
