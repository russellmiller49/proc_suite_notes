NOTE_ID:  note_149 SOURCE_FILE: note_149.txt Procedure: Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
Anesthesia Type: Previously intubated and sedated
Indication: Hypoxia and hemoptysis
Consent: Emergent
Time-Out: Performed
Pre-Procedure Diagnosis: Hemoptysis
Post-Procedure Diagnosis: Hemoptysis versus oral blood aspiration
Medications: Patient previously sedated; topical anesthesia with 10 mL of 2% lidocaine

Procedure Description

The Olympus Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the previously placed endotracheal tube and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. Blood was noted within the endotracheal tube and throughout the airway, beginning near the laryngeal inlet. The tip of the endotracheal tube was visualized approximately 3 cm proximal to the main carina.

Diffuse blood was present throughout the airways, with multiple early clots partially obstructing the bronchi. These were suctioned via the bronchoscope. All left- and right-sided airways were inspected to at least the first subsegmental level and were patent following suctioning, with the exception of a small foreign body identified in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe. This material was suctioned from the airway and appeared consistent with tissue of unclear origin.

No active bleeding was visualized within the distal airways following clot removal; however, continued blood dripping was observed originating proximal to the tip of the endotracheal tube. No obvious airway injury was identified. Once adequate clearance was achieved and no distal bleeding source was identified, the bronchoscope was withdrawn, and the procedure was completed.

Estimated Blood Loss: No procedurally related blood loss
Complications: None
Specimens Sent: None
Implants: None

Recommendations

Plan for repeat bronchoscopy in the morning for additional clearance of blood and clots

Notify the pulmonary service immediately for increasing airway pressures or worsening hypoxia, as these findings may necessitate urgent repeat bronchoscopy

Follow-Up: Continue ICU-level care
