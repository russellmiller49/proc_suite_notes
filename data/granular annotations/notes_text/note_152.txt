Procedure Description

The Olympus Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the previously placed endotracheal tube and advanced into the tracheobronchial tree. The tip of the endotracheal tube was noted to be at the level of the cricoid cartilage and was advanced 5 cm to an appropriate position approximately 2 cm above the carina.

The bronchoscope was then advanced with suction off into the anterior segment of the right lower lobe and wedged into position. Purulent secretions were visualized within this segment. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed with instillation of 120 mL of sterile saline and return of 40 mL using hand suction technique, yielding purulent material.

Following completion of lavage, a complete airway inspection was performed. The remainder of the tracheobronchial tree was normal in appearance, without additional secretions or evidence of endobronchial disease.
