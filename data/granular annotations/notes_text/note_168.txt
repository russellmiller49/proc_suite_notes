NOTE_ID:  note_168 SOURCE_FILE: note_168.txt Indications: Mediastinal Adenopathy with concern for brain mets
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. There was partial dynamic obstruction of the trachea of unclear etiology.  The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree.  Enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes were seen in multiple stations in relatively symmetric pattern. Mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed by transbronchial needle aspiration with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 11L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node followed by the 4L lymph node and finally the 2R lymph node.  A total of 5 biopsies were performed in each station (station 2R 7 samples were collected). ROSE evaluation yielded multiple granulomas from the 11L, 4L and 2R stations and adequate lymphocytes from station 7. All samples were sent for routine cytology and two additional samples were taken for AFB and fungal culture from the station 2R. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood there and secretions there was some slow oozing seen in the bilateral lower lobes. 2ml of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine were instilled into each lower lobe and the bleeding stopped. Once we were confident that there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10ml

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
