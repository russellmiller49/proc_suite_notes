NOTE_ID:  note_179 SOURCE_FILE: note_179.txt Indications: Hilar cyst aspiration 
Procedure: EBUS bronchoscopy – single station
Medications: General Anesthesia
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway initially was not well positioned but after replacement with larger LMA seated in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal with the exception of partial extrinsic compression of the left upper lobe bronchus distal to the lingual and most obvious in the apical segment; there are no endobronchial lesions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The scope was advanced into the proximal left upper lobe and a 45mm heterogeneous cyst with multiple septations was seen just distal to the left PA. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus 19G Visioshot EBUS-TBNA needle. Material was thick which could not be grossly  aspirated through the needle with attached suction. Samples showed thick coagulated bloody material on multiple needle passes consistent with old blood. Rapid onsite pathological evaluation showed heme and multiple foamy macrophages. Samples and fluid were sent for both culture and routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed. 

Complications: No immediate complications
Post-operative diagnosis: Hemorrhagic Hilar cyst
Estimated Blood Loss: 10cc
Recommendations:
- Transferred patient to post-procedural monitoring 
- 10 day course of Augmentin to reduced likelihood of infection of capsulated cystic space. 
- Will await final pathology results
- Repeat CT in 3-4 weeks or earlier if fevers, persistent/worsening chest pain, hemoptysis or other symptoms concerning for infection or cyst rupture.
- Will likely require unroofing and resection with thoracic surgery
