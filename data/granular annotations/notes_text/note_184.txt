NOTE_ID:  note_184 SOURCE_FILE: note_184.txt Indications: Diagnosis and staging of presumed lung cancer
Medications: General Anesthesia,
Procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives were explained to the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was documented as per institutional protocol. A history and physical were performed and updated in the pre-procedure assessment record. Laboratory studies and radiographs were reviewed. A time-out was performed prior to the intervention.
Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway and tracheobronchial tree, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The trachea was of normal caliber. The carina was sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy were normal; there are no endobronchial lesions, and no secretions. The video bronchoscope was then removed and the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling criteria (5mm short axis diameter) were met in station 4R, 4L, Station 5 and 11L lymph nodes. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with the Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle beginning with the 4R Lymph node, followed by the 4L. The 4R yielded benign lymphocytes on ROSE evaluation while the 4L was non-diagnostic.  Given that the station 11L would only stage the patient as N1 disease and the station 5 lymph nodes, which were highly suspicious for malignancy based on FDG avidity and ultrasound characteristics, after careful consideration we decided to attempt biopsy via the trans-vascular route thorough the pulmonary artery a total of 7 passes were performed, Five biopsies were performed with the Boston Scientific 25 gauge EBUS needle and an additional two with Olympus EBUSTBNA 22 gauge needle. ROSE was consistent with poorly differentiated carcinoma. All samples were sent for routine cytology. Following completion of EBUS bronchoscopy, the Q190 video bronchoscope was then re-inserted and after suctioning blood and secretions there was no evidence of active bleeding and the bronchoscope was subsequently removed.

Complications: No immediate complications
Estimated Blood Loss: 10 cc.

Post Procedure Diagnosis:
- Technically successful flexible bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsies.
- The patient has remained stable and has been transferred in good condition to the post-surgical monitoring unit.
- Will await final pathology results
