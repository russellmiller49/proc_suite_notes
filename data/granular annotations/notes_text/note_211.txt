POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease 
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with transbronchial cryobiopsy, 
INDICATIONS: Diffuse parenchymal lung disease
Consent was obtained from the patient prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient acknowledged and gave consent. 
Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After receiving analgesia and paralytics the patient was bag masked and once preoxygenated a 12 mm rigid tracheoscope was inserted into the mid trachea and attached to the jet ventilator. The rigid optic was then removed and the flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid bronchoscope. Inspection bronchoscopy was unremarkable. Subsequently a Forgery balloon was inserted to the rigid bronchoscope into the superior segment of the lingula. Under fluoroscopic guidance the cryoprobe was inserted past the balloon into the lateral left lower lobe segment under fluoroscopic guidance. Once the pleural margin was reached the probe was withdrawn approximately 1 cm and the cryoprobe was activated for 4 seconds at which time the flexible bronchoscope and cryoprobe were removed en-bloc in the Fogarty balloon was inflated immediately after removal. One specimen was removed from the cryoprobe the flexible bronchoscope was reinserted and the balloon was slowly deflated to assess for distal bleeding. The patient did develop some minor hemorrhage which resolved after balloon occlusion. It was difficult to maintain the balloon in place and we converted to an endobronchial blocker which was too large to pass the cryoprobe beyond when inserted into the lingua and we subsequently moved the blocker into the mainstem while completing biopsies.  A total of 6 biopsies were performed. During the procedure the patient developed transient hypoxia requiring us to convert to conventional ventilation and the hypoxia resolved. Once we were confident that there was no active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed.  Following completion of the procedure fluoroscopic evaluation of the pleura was performed to evaluate for pneumothorax and none was seen. The rigid bronchoscope was subsequently removed once the patient was able to breathe spontaneously.
