NOTE_ID:  note_237 SOURCE_FILE: note_237.txt PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: lung cancer with complete left mainstem stenosis. 
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Resolved mainstem obstruction s/p areo stent
PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rigid bronchoscopy with Aero tracheobronchial stent placement in the left mainstem
INDICATIONS: Obstruction of left mainstem bronchus
Consent was obtained from the family prior to procedure after explanation in lay terms the indications, details of procedure, and potential risks and alternatives. The patient’s family acknowledged and gave consent.
Sedation: General Anesthesia
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the main operating room. After administration of sedatives the a10mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the posterior oropharynx. The ETT was removed and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords into the distal trachea and connected to ventilator. Airway inspection was performed and the tracheal and right sided airways were normal. At the proximal aspect of the left mainstem was intrinsic tumor causing complete obstruction of the airway. Using the 2.4 mm cryoprobe we are able to extract portions of the tumor slowly and further extraction was performed using utilized APC and flexible forceps to “burn and shave” the remaining until eventually the LC1 carina was seen. In the left upper lobe the airways appeared normal without evidence of tumor while in the left lower lobe mucosal tumor invasion was present but non-obstructive to at least the first subsegments. Although we were able to debulk the majority of tumor in the mainstem there remained significant residual tumor burden causing partial airway obstruction and it was decided to place and Aero SEMS to maintain patency and for barrier effect. At this point we measured the length of the obstruction and inserted a Jagwire through the flexible bronchoscope into the left lower lobe past the mainstem and using fluoroscopy marked the proximal and distal edges of the obstructed left mainstem with radiopaque markers (paper clips) taped to the patient’s chest wall.  The flexible bronchoscope was removed and an Aero 12x40 mm stent was advanced over the guidewire and positioned based on the external markers under fluoroscopic observation. The flexible bronchoscope was re-inserted and the stent was evaluated and was in appropriate position with a residual airway of >90% of normal. Once we were satisfied that no further intervention was required and that there was no evidence of active bleeding the flexible bronchoscope was removed and bronchoscopic intubation was performed with an 8.0 ETT and the procedure was completed.
Recommendations:
-          Transfer back to ICU
-          Post-procedure x-ray
-          Start 3% saline nebs 4cc 3 times daily for stent maintenance.
-          Ensure supplemental oxygen is humidified
-          Please arrange for patient to have nebulizer at home for continued hypertonic saline nebs post-discharge.
