CPT 31641 Bronchoscopy destruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (eg. laser therapy, cryotherapy)
CPT 31624 Bronchoscopy with bronchial alveolar lavage

INDICATIONS: Airway stent occlusion 

Sedation: General Anesthesia

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. After administration of sedatives an LMA was inserted and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and into the trachea. The patients known Silicone Y-stent was well positioned. There was signifigant thich dry mucous with mild obstruction of the tracheal limb, moderate obstruction of the left bronchial limb and significant obstruction of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially obstructed by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no evidence of post-obstructive pneumonia and all right sided segmental airways were patent without endobronchial disease. On the left the distal mainstem, lower lobe bronchi were patient without evidence of endobronchial disease. At the anterior aspect of the left upper lobe takeoff there was partially obstructive endobronchial tumor causing approximately 40% reduction in caliber which did not warrant treatment at this time. Through a combination of mechanical debulking with the bronchoscope tip, forceps debulking and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was slowly removed, with near complete recanalization of the stents. Subsequently a mini BAL was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe with 40cc instillation and 30cc return. At this point inspection was performed to evaluate for any bleeding or other complications and none was seen. The bronchoscope was removed and the procedure was completed. 

Recommendations:
- Transfer to PACU
- Discharge once criteria met.
