Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy\n2. Radial EBUS\n3. Transbronchial biopsies\n4. Bronchoalveolar lavage\n\nINDICATION: 64M with remote history of colon cancer (stage II, 2010) now with multiple lung nodules. Largest nodule RLL posterior segment 2.6cm, PET SUV 5.1. Other nodules range 0.8-1.4cm bilaterally. Biopsy needed for diagnosis.\n\nCONSENT: Standard procedural risks discussed including but not limited to pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, chest tube placement. Questions answered. Written consent obtained.\n\nANESTHESIA DETAILS:\nPatient [REDACTED] OR, monitored anesthesia care established. General anesthesia induced with propofol, fentanyl, rocuronium. Intubation with 8.0 ETT placed at 22cm, confirmed with ETCO2 and auscultation.\n\nVentilation: Pressure control mode, Pinsp 18, RR 14, PEEP 5, FiO2 55%, Pmean 13\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\n\nTime-out performed confirming patient id[REDACTED], procedure, and site. All imaging reviewed.\n\nCT chest with contrast from [REDACTED] imported to Intuitive Ion planning system. Three-dimensional airway reconstruction performed. Navigation plan created to RLL posterior segment nodule (largest/most FDG-avid lesion).\n\nIon bronchoscope inserted through ETT. Initial airway survey:\n- Vocal cords: not visualized (via ETT)\n- Trachea: patent, mild anterior bowing, no stenosis\n- Carina: sharp, mobile\n- Right mainstem: patent\n- Left mainstem: patent, no endobronchial lesions\n\nAutomatic registration initiated. Adequate landmark correlation achieved. Fiducial error: 1.5mm. Confidence sweep performed - stable alignment throughout planned trajectory.\n\nIon catheter advanced to RLL posterior segment under navigational guidance. Real-time position tracking showed tool-to-target distance of 0.6cm.\n\nRadial EBUS (20MHz probe) inserted through Ion extended working channel. Probe advanced to target showing concentric echogenic pattern with heterogeneous internal echo. Lesion measured 24mm in largest dimension.\n\nCone-beam CT acquired for trajectory verification. Fusion overlay (NaviLink) confirmed catheter tip within lesion borders, 4mm from center.\n\nSAMPLING PERFORMED:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies x 7 (formalin for histology)\n- Cytology brushings x 3 (ThinPrep)\n- BAL from RLL posterior segment: 100cc instilled, 45cc return (sent for cell count, bacterial/fungal/AFB cultures, cytology)\n\nROSE: Preliminary cytology shows atypical cells, cannot exclude malignancy. Final pathology pending.\n\nHemostasis confirmed with direct visualization. No active bleeding. Airways suctioned clear.\n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY:\n- RLL posterior segment nodule successfully localized and sampled\n- No endobronchial lesions\n- No significant bleeding\n\nPatient [REDACTED] well. Extubated in OR without difficulty. Transferred to PACU in stable condition, oxygen saturation 98% on 2L NC.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10mL\n\nSPECIMENS: As listed above\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE PLAN:\n1. Routine post-bronchoscopy monitoring\n2. Chest X-ray in 2 hours to r/o pneumothorax\n3. Discharge home same day if CXR negative and stable\n4. Follow-up IP clinic 2 weeks for pathology results\n5. If additional nodules need sampling after final path review, will schedule staged procedure\n\nProcedure supervised and performed by Dr. Melissa Anderson, Attending Physician.",

This supports a comprehensive navigation + peripheral EBUS + TBBx + BAL code set. ",
        "Code selection: 31627 is justified by detailed documentation of CT-based planning, 3D airway reconstruction, registration, and computer-assisted tool navigation to a peripheral lesion; 31654 is justified by the radial EBUS imaging used to confirm lesion position before sampling; 31628 is supported by multiple transbronchial biopsies of a single RLL lobe; 31624 is supported by the documented BAL with specific instill/return volumes and tests ordered. This aligns with the IP coding & billing v2.7 knowledge base for navigational bronchoscopy with peripheral lesion biopsy. ",
        "Bundling/modifier review: The combination 31627 + 31654 + 31628 + 31624 is allowed per interventional pulmonology coding guidance when a single session includes navigational bronchoscopy, peripheral EBUS confirmation, transbronchial biopsy, and BAL in the same lobe. No separate mediastinal EBUS codes (31652/31653) or additional biopsy codes are indicated. No modifier -59/-XS is required because all services are components of a single integrated navigational bronchoscopy encounter for one peripheral target. ",
        "Registry consistency: The registry_entry correctly reflects general anesthesia, ETT airway, Ion robotic platform, radial EBUS use, and peripheral sampling tools (forceps, brush), which are congruent with the chosen CPT set and support the RVU/payment mapping derived from the coding knowledge and bronchoscopy reimbursement tables.

The patient acknowledged and gave consent.\nSedation: General Anesthesia\n\nDescription of Procedure:\nThe procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite. An I-gel LMA was placed and the diagnostic flexible bronchoscope was inserted through the airway device. The vocal cords were visualized and normal. The subglottic space was normal. Approximately 3 cm below the vocal cords, there was a long segment stenotic lesion which was erythematous and inflamed in a circumferential pattern measuring 5 cm in length. The maximal obstruction within the long segment was approximately 60% with an endoluminal diameter of 6-7 mm. There were no simple strictures associated with the stenosis. The carina was sharp.\n\nOn the right, there were mucosal changes/erythema without obstruction on the posterior wall of the right mainstem and at the entrance to the right upper lobe. The right upper lobe and mainstem appeared unaffected. The bronchus intermedius was mostly unaffected with small mucosal irregularities. The right middle lobe was minimally narrowed without significant obstruction. There was mild stricturing on the right lower lobe orifice (approximately 10% obstruction). The medial basal segment of the right lower lobe was concentrically obstructed from stricture with only a pinpoint opening (95% occluded). A similar circumferential obstruction was seen at the orifice of the superior segment (80% occluded). The anterior, lateral, and posterior basal segments were partially obstructed from stricture (50%).\n\nOn the left, the mainstem was normal. The left upper lobe proper was normal. The lingula was obstructed at the orifice by a similar appearing circumferential obstruction (50% occluded). The superior segment of the left lower lobe was also minimally obstructed from stricture (15% obstructed). The basal segments of the left lower lobe were unaffected.\n\nFollowing inspection, we then brought our attention to the tracheal stenosis and serial dilatations were performed with 3 cm length with a 12, 13.5, 15 CRE balloon with post-dilatation obstruction of 25% of normal airway. We then inserted the electrocautery knife through the working channel and cuts were made to the band-like strictures within the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe. Serial dilatations were performed using the 6, 7, 8 CRE balloon to the lingula, the superior segment of the right lower lobe, medial basal segments of the right lower lobe, and anterior and lateral basilar segments of the right lower lobe with near complete recanalization of the segments, after which the flexible bronchoscope could easily be passed into the segments. At this point, once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed.\n\nRecommendations:\n• Patient to PACU for recovery\n• Patient to follow up with me PRN if symptoms return\n\nGregory Hamilton, MD",

A T190 video bronchoscope was then advanced orally through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree. Initial inspection revealed normal vocal cords and subglottic space. Significant fresh and clotted blood was present throughout the airway. The proximal and mid trachea appeared normal. The distal trachea and main carina demonstrated extensive friable tumor infiltration causing combined extrinsic and intrinsic obstruction—approximately 15% in the distal trachea, 50% in the proximal left mainstem bronchus, and up to 75% in the right mainstem bronchus. After copious suctioning, the left mainstem bronchus beyond the subcarinal region was clear and normal. The right mainstem bronchus showed diffuse tumor infiltration causing up to 90% obstruction proximally and extending into the proximal right upper lobe bronchus with approximately 85% obstruction. Distal to this region, the airways appeared uninvolved, including the bronchus intermedius, right middle, and lower lobes.\n\nThe video bronchoscope and LMA were then removed. A 12 mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was inserted through the mouth and advanced into the distal trachea. Jet ventilation was initiated via the Monsoon ventilator. Using a therapeutic bronchoscope inserted through the rigid scope, cryotherapy was performed to remove adherent thick clots.\n\nSubsequently, the UC180F convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was utilized to visualize and biopsy the large subcarinal mass. Five transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) were conducted using the Olympus Vizishot 2 EBUS TBNA 22-gauge needle. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignant cells. Flexible forceps biopsies were also obtained from visible endobronchial tumor and specimens were preserved in formalin.\n\nThe tumor, which was friable and prone to bleeding, was debulked using Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) for cautery and mechanical debulking through the rigid bronchoscope. After extensive debulking, significant improvement was achieved: the left mainstem bronchus residual obstruction reduced to approximately 10%, and the right mainstem bronchus reduced to approximately 25%.\n\nPersistent diffuse oozing from the tumor bed prompted instillation of 6 cc topical tranexamic acid via flexible bronchoscope. Persistent bleeding was controlled by direct application of three Surgicel pledgets for approximately one minute, successfully achieving hemostasis.\n\nFollowing verification of hemostasis, the rigid bronchoscope was removed, and patient care was transitioned back to anesthesia.\n\nComplications: None\nEstimated Blood Loss: 30 cc\n\nPost-procedure Recommendations:\n- Admit to ICU overnight for close observation and continuation of nebulized tranexamic acid\n- Await pathology results\n- Upon receipt of preliminary pathology, prompt multidisciplinary discussion with radiation oncology and medical oncology recommended to initiate treatment planning and prevent tumor recurrence and further airway compromise\n\n________________________________________",
