  "5346131": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Robert Patel, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nPeripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes. Target lesion: 24.3mm solid nodule localized to LUL superior lingula (B4).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 21-gauge aspiration needle (Standard FNA).\n\nStation 4L: Visualized homogeneous node (21.5x32.3mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10L: Visualized homogeneous node (21.1x12.4mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 11L: Visualized homogeneous node (8.8x15.4mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Ion robotic navigation platform (Intuitive Surgical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 1.5mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the LUL superior lingula (B4) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding eccentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 4\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 2  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from LUL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Adequate lymphocytes\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (3 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nRobert Patel, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nMemorial Hospital"
