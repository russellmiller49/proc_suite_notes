  "5562789_syn_2": "PROCEDURE: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was utilized to localize a 3.1 cm spiculated RUL lesion. Following registration and navigation, radial EBUS confirmed a concentric solid lesion. Transbronchial sampling (forceps, brush, needle) yielded non-small cell carcinoma. A fiducial marker was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance to facilitate future stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).",
