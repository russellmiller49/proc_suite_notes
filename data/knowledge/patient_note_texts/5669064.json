  "5669064": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Rachel Goldman, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nRight upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Target lesion: 20.2mm solid nodule localized to LUL inferior lingula (B5).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 21-gauge aspiration needle (Standard FNA).\n\nStation 4L: Visualized homogeneous node (24.4x26.8mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 7: Visualized homogeneous node (20.3x30.7mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 10R: Visualized homogeneous node (20.4x33.1mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Atypical cells.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Galaxy robotic navigation platform (Noah Medical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 2.3mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the LUL inferior lingula (B5) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding concentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via radial ebus.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 7\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 4  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from LUL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (3 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nRachel Goldman, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nCommunity Hospital"
