Following radial EBUS confirmation, initial forceps biopsies suggested adenocarcinoma on ROSE. To ensure adequate tissue for molecular testing, transbronchial cryobiopsy was subsequently performed with a bronchial blocker in place for hemostasis. The procedure was uncomplicated.",

Two thoracenteses with non-diagnostic cytology. CT chest shows nodular pleural thickening. Pleuroscopy for diagnosis and possible therapeutic intervention.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- H&P completed, informed consent obtained\n- Risks discussed: bleeding, infection, pneumothorax, need for chest tube, respiratory complications, empyema\n- Timeout performed per institutional protocol\n- CT chest reviewed: right pleural effusion with nodular pleural enhancement\n- Labs: Platelets 245K, INR 1.0, normal renal function\n- Echocardiogram: EF 60%, no significant valvular disease\n- Vital signs: BP 128/72, HR 78, SpO2 96% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:** \n- Monitored anesthesia care with propofol infusion\n- Local anesthesia at access sites\n- Total IV propofol: 420 mg\n- Patient tolerated well\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Left lateral decubitus position\n- Right arm suspended overhead\n- Pulse oximetry, BP monitoring, cardiac monitoring\n\n*Access:*\n- Ultrasound used to id[REDACTED] pleural effusion and safe entry site\n- Right lateral chest, 7th intercostal space, mid-axillary line\n- Local anesthesia: 20 mL 1% lidocaine\n- 10 mm incision made\n- Blunt dissection to pleura\n- Pleural fluid evacuated: 450 mL straw-colored fluid\n- 10 mm trocar inserted under direct visualization\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid pleuroscope (Karl Storz 7mm, 0-degree) inserted\n- Systematic inspection of pleural cavity performed\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Multiple white/tan nodules (3-8 mm) diffusely distributed over visceral pleura, particularly over lower lobe. Areas of pleural thickening noted.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Nodular involvement of parietal pleura with studding pattern. Multiple 5-15 mm nodular lesions along posterolateral chest wall.\n- **Diaphragm:** Diaphragmatic pleura with several nodular implants\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion appeared restricted, suggesting trapped lung physiology\n- **Overall Impression:** Extensive pleural carcinomatosis\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple pleural biopsies obtained from parietal pleura (6 specimens)\n- Multiple pleural biopsies from visceral pleura (4 specimens)\n- Optical forceps used for biopsies\n- Hemostasis confirmed after each biopsy\n- Specimens submitted in formalin for histopathology\n\n*Therapeutic Intervention:*\n- Due to trapped lung physiology, chemical pleurodesis deferred\n- Complete fluid drainage: total 1,200 mL\n- 24 French chest tube placed under direct visualization\n- Chest tube secured to skin\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient transferred to recovery in stable condition\n- Chest tube to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube in good position, small residual effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Patient awake, alert, breathing comfortably\n- Vital signs: BP 132/76, HR 82, SpO2 97% on 2L NC\n- Pain controlled with IV fentanyl followed by PO oxycodone\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (10 specimens total) - histopathology\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell count, chemistry, cultures\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:** \nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy revealing extensive pleural carcinomatosis consistent with malignant pleural mesothelioma or metastatic adenocarcinoma. Trapped lung physiology noted precluding pleurodesis. Adequate tissue obtained for diagnosis.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**DISPOSITION:** Admitted for chest tube management and awaiting pathology results\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube to water seal, monitor output\n- Serial chest X-rays\n- Pain management\n- Await final pathology (expected 3-5 days)\n- Oncology consultation\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion\n- Likely will require indwelling pleural catheter for definitive management given trapped lung\n- Remove chest tube when output <150 mL/24 hours and no air leak\n- Follow up in clinic post-discharge"
