A fungating endobronchial mass was observed in the RUL, obstructing the superior and anterior segments. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and forceps biopsies were obtained. Radial EBUS localization facilitated sampling of a second lesion in the LLL superior segment via TBNA and forceps. A bronchoalveolar lavage was also performed in the LLL. Hemostasis was achieved with topical epinephrine."
