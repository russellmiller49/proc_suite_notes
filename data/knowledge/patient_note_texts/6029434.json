Patient id[REDACTED] confirmed with two id[REDACTED]\n2. Informed consent verified on chart\n3. NPO status confirmed (>8 hours)\n4. Anticoagulation status reviewed - not on anticoagulation\n5. Allergies reviewed - NKDA\n6. Time-out performed with all team members\n\nINDICATION:\nLung cancer staging - suspected NSCLC with mediastinal lymphadenopathy\nTarget lesion: 15.4mm ground-glass nodule, RML lateral (B4)\nBronchus sign: Positive\n\nANESTHESIA:\nType: General anesthesia\nAirway: 8.0mm ETT, oral\nInduction: Standard IV induction by anesthesia team\n\nEQUIPMENT USED:\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: 21G Standard FNA\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS: 20 MHz miniprobe\n- Biopsy forceps: Standard\n- Cytology brushes: Standard\n\nPROCEDURE STEPS:\n\nPART A - LINEAR EBUS FOR STAGING:\n1. Bronchoscope inserted through ETT\n2. Standard airway inspection performed - airways patent, no endobronchial lesions\n3. Linear EBUS scope exchanged\n4. Systematic lymph node survey performed\n5. Following stations id[REDACTED] and sampled:\n   - Station 10R: 15.1mm, 3 passes\n   - Station 4L: 21.5mm, 2 passes\n   - Station 4R: 12.6mm, 2 passes\n   - Station 11L: 22.8mm, 4 passes\n6. ROSE performed - cytopathologist present\n7. ROSE results: Adequate lymphocytes\n\nPART B - ROBOTIC NAVIGATION:\n1. Monarch system prepared and registered\n2. Registration error: 2.5mm (acceptable)\n3. Robotic catheter advanced to RML lateral (B4)\n4. Radial EBUS deployed - Adjacent view obtained\n5. Tool-in-lesion confirmed with Radial EBUS\n6. Sampling performed:\n   - Forceps biopsies: 7\n   - TBNA passes: 4\n   - Brushings: 2\n7. ROSE performed - Atypical cells\n8. BAL obtained from RML\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE:\n1. Airways inspected - no active bleeding\n2. Bronchoscope removed\n3. Patient extubated without difficulty\n4. Post-procedure CXR ordered - no pneumothorax\n5. Patient to recovery area\n\nSPECIMENS SENT:\n1. EBUS-TBNA (stations 10R, 4L, 4R, 11L) → Cytology, cell block\n2. TBBx RML → Surgical pathology\n3. Brushings → Cytology\n4. BAL → Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Completed EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging\n2. Completed robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. No immediate complications\n\nPLAN:\n1. Monitor in recovery x 2 hours\n2. Discharge home if stable\n3. Follow-up in clinic for pathology results\n4. Results to be discussed at tumor board\n\nProcedure performed under direct supervision of Brian O'Connor, MD\n\nFellow, PGY-None\nBrian O'Connor, MD (Attending - present for entire procedure)"
