Using the Ion system and Cone Beam CT, we precisely targeted a nodule in his right upper lobe and obtained multiple biopsies using needle and cryoprobe. Following the biopsy, we assessed his left upper lobe for collateral ventilation using the Chartis system, which indicated he might be a good candidate for valves in the future."
