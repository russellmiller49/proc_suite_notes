  "6330785": "THERAPEUTIC BRONCHOSCOPY NOTE\nDate: [REDACTED]\nPatient: [REDACTED] | MRN: [REDACTED] | Age: 59F\nAttending: Dr. Kevin Park, MD\nFellow: Dr. Jennifer Walsh, MD (PGY-6)\nLocation: [REDACTED]\n\nINDICATION: Stage IIIB non-small cell lung cancer with near-complete obstruction of left mainstem bronchus causing post-obstructive pneumonia and respiratory failure. Palliative airway recanalization.\n\nPROCEDURE:\n1. Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Tumor debulking with rigid coring/mechanical debridement\n3. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) for hemostasis and tumor ablation\n4. Balloon dilation\n5. Silicone stent placement, left mainstem\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia, jet ventilation\n\nFINDINGS & PROCEDURE:\nUnder GA, rigid bronchoscope (12mm Dumon) introduced. \n- Trachea: Patent\n- Carina: Normal\n- Right lung: Patent\n- Left mainstem: >95% occluded by exophytic, necrotic tumor arising from posterolateral wall\n\nTUMOR DEBULKING:\nRigid coring performed to remove bulk of intraluminal tumor. Significant necrotic debris evacuated. APC (ERBE, 40W) applied for hemostasis and ablation of residual tumor at margins. Estimated 80% tumor removed with resulting lumen ~10mm.\n\nBALLOON DILATION:\nCRE balloon (15mm x 40mm) used to dilate narrowed segment to accept stent. 3 inflations at 6 ATM.\n\nSTENT PLACEMENT:\nNovatech Dumon silicone stent (14mm x 40mm) deployed over the debulked segment. Good expansion. Proximal and distal ends 1cm beyond visible tumor.\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE:\n- Pre-obstruction: >95%\n- Post-procedure: <20% (patent stent lumen)\n- LLL and lingula now ventilated\n\nSPECIMENS: Tumor fragments to surgical pathology\nCOMPLICATIONS: Moderate bleeding - controlled with APC\nEBL: 75mL\nDISPOSITION: SICU overnight then step-down\n\nDr. Kevin Park, MD"
