  "6346626_syn_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: Medical Thoracoscopy with Parietal Pleural Biopsy and Pleurodesis.\nINDICATIONS: Malignant pleural effusion staging.\nINTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Extensive visceral pleural metastasis observed. Eleven biopsy specimens were harvested from the parietal surface for histopathological confirmation. Due to the malignant appearance, chemical pleurodesis was undertaken utilizing sterile talc insufflation.\nCOMPLICATIONS: None. Hemostasis achieved.",
  "6346626_syn_3": "Codes: 32609 (Thoracoscopy with biopsy); 32650 (Thoracoscopy with pleurodesis).\nRationale: Distinct procedural components performed. Biopsies (x11) obtained from parietal pleura for diagnosis. Separate therapeutic intervention (talc poudrage) performed for effusion management given gross findings.",

  "6346626_syn_5": "Note for Sharon Lee doing the scope for staging. Went in left side mod sedation. Yeah there were tumor implants everywhere on the visceral pleura. We grabbed like 11 biopsies from the chest wall side. Decided to do the talc while we were there to stop the fluid coming back. Chest tube in no air leak sending to floor.",
  "6346626_syn_6": "Medical Thoracoscopy with Pleural Biopsy and Talc Poudrage. Patient is a 71-year-old female. Indication was staging for lung cancer. Under moderate sedation, the left pleural space was accessed. Findings included visceral pleural tumor implants. Multiple biopsies (11) were obtained from the parietal pleura. Talc poudrage was performed for pleurodesis. A chest tube was placed. Hemostasis was confirmed.",

Using a camera, we inspected the space and unfortunately saw spots on the lung surface consistent with tumor. We took eleven samples from the chest wall for the lab. Because of the fluid buildup, we also sprayed medical talc into the space to seal it up. She is recovering with a tube in place.",
