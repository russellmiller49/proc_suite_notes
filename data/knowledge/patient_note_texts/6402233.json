  "6402233": "Christine Garcia, MRN [REDACTED], a 62-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Presbyterian Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 16.9mm solid lesion in the RML lateral (B4), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 16.9. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 58 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC190F bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (9.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy); station 4L (13.8mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma); station 4R (21.4mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.5mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RML lateral (B4) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by augmented fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (8 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed adequate lymphocytes.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 100 minutes. Attending physician: David Kim, MD."
