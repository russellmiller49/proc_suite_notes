FEV1 28% predicted. CT shows intact fissures. Candidate for endobronchial valve therapy (BLVR).\n\nPROCEDURE: \n1. Flexible bronchoscopy\n2. Chartis collateral ventilation assessment (LUL)\n3. Endobronchial valve placement (LUL)\n\nANESTHESIA: General anesthesia\n\nCHARTIS ASSESSMENT:\nLUL evaluated using Chartis system via balloon catheter at LB1+2 combined orifice:\n- Adequate seal obtained\n- Measurement duration: 5 minutes\n- Flow pattern: Decreasing to zero\n- Result: CV NEGATIVE (favorable for valve therapy)\n\nVALVE PLACEMENT:\nBased on CV negative result and CT planning, Zephyr valves (Pulmonx) placed:\n1. LB1+2: Zephyr 5.5mm - deployed, seal confirmed\n2. LB3: Zephyr 5.0mm - deployed, seal confirmed  \n3. LB4+5 (Lingula): Zephyr 4.0-LP - deployed, seal confirmed\n4. LB6: Zephyr 5.5mm - deployed, seal confirmed\n\nTotal: 4 Zephyr valves placed in complete LUL lobar occlusion\n\nPost-procedure bronchoscopy confirmed all valves seated with no visible air leak.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nDISPOSITION: Admit overnight for pneumothorax monitoring. CXR q6h x 24hr.\n\nFOLLOW-UP: CT chest in 6-8 weeks, PFTs at 3 months, 6 months.\n\nDr. Sarah Kim, MD"
