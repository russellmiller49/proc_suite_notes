  "6609863": "Adam Morgan, MRN [REDACTED], a 64-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at UCLA Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes with a 27.1mm ground-glass lesion in the LLL posterior basal (B10), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 15.4. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 40 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 2L (20.2mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 4R (17.2mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 7 (11.6mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (17.2mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Granuloma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.9mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL posterior basal (B10) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed atypical cells.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 85 minutes. Attending physician: David Kim, MD."
