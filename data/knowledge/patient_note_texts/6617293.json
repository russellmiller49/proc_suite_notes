  "6617293_syn_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: [REDACTED] for diagnostic pleuroscopy. Under MAC, the left hemithorax was accessed. Inspection revealed diffuse, confluent nodularity of the parietal and visceral pleura, suggestive of malignancy. Multiple biopsies were obtained. Due to extensive visceral restriction (trapped lung), pleurodesis was contraindicated. A 24 Fr chest tube was placed for drainage. The clinical picture strongly favors malignant pleural mesothelioma.",

We are very suspicious this is mesothelioma. Because the lung is trapped by this tissue and cannot expand, we could not seal the space today. Instead, we took biopsies and placed a chest tube to keep the fluid drained while we wait for results.",

White-yellow plaques visible. Areas of pleural fibrosis.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Marked thickening (up to 1 cm estimated) with diffuse nodular changes. Cobblestone appearance in areas. No discrete masses but confluent involvement.\n- **Diaphragm:** Diaphragmatic pleura significantly thickened and irregular\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion limited due to visceral pleural involvement (trapped lung)\n- **Overall Impression:** Diffuse pleural thickening and nodularity highly suspicious for malignant mesothelioma\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple deep pleural biopsies from parietal pleura (10 specimens)\n- Biopsies included pleural tissue and underlying muscle\n- Rigid forceps used for adequate tissue samples\n- 3 biopsies from visceral pleura (limited by trapped lung)\n- Additional biopsy sent for special studies (electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry)\n- Hemostasis confirmed after each biopsy\n\n*Therapeutic Consideration:*\n- Due to trapped lung physiology, pleurodesis not performed\n- Would be ineffective given inability of lung to expand\n- Complete drainage: total 1,350 mL turbid fluid\n- 24 French chest tube placed under direct visualization\n- Tube positioned for optimal drainage\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* None\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient stable, transferred to recovery\n- Chest tube to water seal with -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube in place, trapped lung confirmed with inability to expand to chest wall, no pneumothorax\n- Patient breathing comfortably\n- Vital signs: BP 136/82, HR 78, SpO2 95% on 2L NC\n- Pain controlled (3/10 with IV medications)\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (13 specimens) - histopathology\n- Tissue for immunohistochemistry (mesothelioma panel)\n- Tissue for electron microscopy\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell count, chemistry\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy with findings highly suspicious for malignant pleural mesothelioma.
