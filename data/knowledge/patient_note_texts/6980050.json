  "6980050": "Donald Gray, MRN [REDACTED], a 77-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 23.2mm ground-glass lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 16.0. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 55 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11R (13.7mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 2L (8.4mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 4L (19.6mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system (Noah Medical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL lateral basal (B9) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed suspicious for malignancy.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 105 minutes. Attending physician: Jennifer Walsh, MD."
