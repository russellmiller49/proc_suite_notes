  "7134852": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: David Kim, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nPET-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Target lesion: 20.0mm solid nodule localized to RML medial (B5).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 22-gauge aspiration needle (Acquire).\n\nStation 2L: Visualized homogeneous node (13.8x21.0mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\nStation 4R: Visualized heterogeneous node (23.9x31.2mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 11R: Visualized heterogeneous node (19.6x30.0mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Atypical cells.\nStation 11L: Visualized heterogeneous node (17.4x22.1mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Ion robotic navigation platform (Intuitive Surgical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 2.5mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the RML medial (B5) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding adjacent visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via augmented fluoroscopy.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 7\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 2  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from RML\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Malignant - NSCLC NOS\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (4 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nDavid Kim, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center"
