  "7199625": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Andrew Nakamura, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nLung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Target lesion: 25.0mm solid nodule localized to LUL anterior (B3).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 21-gauge aspiration needle (Standard FNA).\n\nStation 7: Visualized heterogeneous node (19.5x24.9mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Granuloma.\nStation 11L: Visualized homogeneous node (18.1x17.4mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\nStation 10R: Visualized heterogeneous node (17.1x27.3mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Granuloma.\nStation 4L: Visualized homogeneous node (11.5x24.9mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Atypical cells.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Monarch robotic navigation platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 1.6mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the LUL anterior (B3) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding eccentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via fluoroscopy.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 4\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 3  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from LUL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (4 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nAndrew Nakamura, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center"
