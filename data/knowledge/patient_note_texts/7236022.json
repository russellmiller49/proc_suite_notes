  "7236022": "Justin Henderson, MRN [REDACTED], a 43-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 30.4mm solid lesion in the RML lateral (B4), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 13.0. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 46 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope with 22-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 2R (15.3mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (23.0mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy); station 4R (15.0mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS); station 7 (13.7mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.6mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RML lateral (B4) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by radial ebus. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (4 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed suspicious for malignancy.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 79 minutes. Attending physician: Lisa Thompson, MD."
