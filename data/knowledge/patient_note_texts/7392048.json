CT from 3/14 loaded. Target = RUL posterior segment.\n\nAuto-registration done - looked good, 7 points matched.\n\nNavigated to target with locatable guide. Got to about 6mm from target per system.\n\nREBUS showed concentric pattern, lesion ~25mm, irregular margins, solid appearance.\n\nBiopsied through guide sheath:\n- 7 forceps biopsies (good tissue each time)\n- 3 brushings\n- Washing for micro + cyto\n\nROSE = Dr. Park says \"definite malignancy, squamous features\"\n\nNo bleeding. Patient did great. CXR ordered.\n\n**Specimens:**\n- TBBx x7 → path (formalin)\n- Brushings x3 → cyto\n- Washing → micro/cyto\n\n**Next steps:**\nStage (brain MRI, confirm PET covers everything), tumor board, likely surgery candidate given isolated RUL lesion, good PFTs.
