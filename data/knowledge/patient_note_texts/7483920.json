Used needle to get samples.\nStation 7 - Did 4 needle passes Quick look by pathologist: CANCER CELLS FOUND (adenocarcinoma type)\nStation 4R - Did 3 passes Quick look: Also shows cancer\nStation 10R - Did 2 passes\nQuick look: Normal lymph node\nStation 11R - Did 2 passes Quick look: Normal\nBottom line: Cancer spread to lymph nodes in chest (N2 disease)\nNo problems during procedure.
