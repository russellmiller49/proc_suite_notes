NO - ERROR IN PROMPT, THIS IS A BIOPSY). *Correction*: The input JSON has CPT 31622/31647 but the text describes a BIOPSY. *Wait, let me check the source text in prompt again.* Note 7 text says 'Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy...'. Registry says 31622, 31647. *Coding Review in source* says 'Primary CPT 31647... Rationale: Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction'. **CRITICAL CONFLICT**. The text describes a biopsy, the coding review describes BLVR. I must follow the TEXT style, but the metadata might be weird. actually, looking at the provided JSON in the prompt... Note 7 text is 'Antonio M. Rodriguez... Ion robotic navigational bronchoscopy'. The registry CPTs are 31622, 31647. The coding review says 'Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction'. This is a mismatch in the source data provided in the prompt. I will generate variations based on the **TEXT** (Biopsy) but I cannot fix the CPTs in the variation generation (the script just copies metadata).
