Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 09:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 10:46\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 91 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Cook EchoTip ProCore 19G (19G FNB/ProCore)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 10R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 11.4mm (short axis) x 28.9mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 19G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 7: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.1mm (short axis) x 19.7mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 19G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 2R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 13.6mm (short axis) x 28.0mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 19G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 4R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 22.2mm (short axis) x 33.2mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 19G needle. ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL posterior basal (B10)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 19.5 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 12.5 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n- PET SUV max: 5.4\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 7 specimens\n- TBNA: 3 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - NSCLC NOS\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 10R, 7, 2R, 4R - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nEric Johnson\nInterventional Pulmonology\nSt. Luke's Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n"
