  "8050365": "Henry Peterson, MRN [REDACTED], a 78-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Community Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup with a 23.3mm solid lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 2.8. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 25 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 21-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (11.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma); station 4R (21.4mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 7 (16.1mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Granuloma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system (Noah Medical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.4mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL posterior basal (B10) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by cbct. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 125 minutes. Attending physician: Lisa Thompson, MD."
