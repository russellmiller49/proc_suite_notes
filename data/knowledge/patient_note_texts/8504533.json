  "8504533": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Eric Johnson, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nLung cancer staging - suspected NSCLC with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Target lesion: 19.5mm solid nodule localized to RLL posterior basal (B10).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 19-gauge aspiration needle (FNB/ProCore).\n\nStation 10R: Visualized heterogeneous node (11.4x28.9mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 7: Visualized homogeneous node (8.1x19.7mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 2R: Visualized heterogeneous node (13.6x28.0mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 4R: Visualized heterogeneous node (22.2x33.2mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Ion robotic navigation platform (Intuitive Surgical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 3.2mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the RLL posterior basal (B10) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding adjacent visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via fluoroscopy.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 7\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 3  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from RLL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Malignant - NSCLC NOS\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (4 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nEric Johnson, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nSt. Luke's Medical Center"
