  "8787443": "Stephen Torres, MRN [REDACTED], a 69-year-old male underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on [REDACTED]. The indication was right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes with a 29.4mm part-solid lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9), bronchus sign negative. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of 43 pack-years (current). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Pentax EB-1990i bronchoscope with 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (15.5mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy); station 10L (21.7mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 11R (20.5mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the LLL lateral basal (B9) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 81 minutes. Attending physician: Brian O'Connor, MD."
