Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Galaxy platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 10:30\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 12:49\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 139 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4022 (22G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Galaxy (Noah Medical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 2R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.0mm (short axis) x 33.3mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 12.9mm (short axis) x 26.6mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 13.9mm (short axis) x 22.9mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RLL medial basal (B7)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 23.3 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 34.7 mm\n- CT appearance: Solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Radial EBUS\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 2R, 10R, 2L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nDavid Kim\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n"
