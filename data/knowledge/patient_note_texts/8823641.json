Exudative effusion, cytology negative x2. PET-CT showing pleural FDG uptake concerning for metastatic disease. Pleuroscopy for diagnosis and staging.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Comprehensive pre-procedure evaluation completed\n- Informed consent obtained, alternatives discussed\n- Multidisciplinary discussion with oncology and thoracic surgery\n- Timeout performed per protocol\n- CT chest: moderate right pleural effusion with pleural nodularity\n- PET-CT: Focal areas of increased uptake (SUV max 6.8) in right pleura\n- Labs: WBC 6.2K, Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, Platelets 223K, INR 1.0\n- Vital signs: BP 122/68, HR 82, SpO2 95% on RA\n\n**ANESTHESIA:**\n- Monitored anesthesia care\n- Propofol infusion (total dose 580 mg)\n- Fentanyl 150 mcg IV total\n- Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula\n- Patient maintained spontaneous ventilation throughout\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n\n*Patient Positioning:*\n- Left lateral decubitus position with careful padding\n- Right arm abducted and supported\n- Standard monitoring: pulse oximetry, ECG, BP\n\n*Access:*\n- Ultrasound used to map effusion and select entry site\n- Right lateral chest, 6th intercostal space, posterior axillary line\n- Betadine prep followed by chlorhexidine\n- Local anesthesia: 22 mL 1% lidocaine to skin, subcutaneous tissues, and pleura\n- 12 mm incision created\n- Blunt dissection to pleura using Kelly clamp\n- Digital palpation confirmed pleural space\n- Initial pleural fluid drainage: 800 mL bloody fluid\n- 10 mm trocar inserted\n\n*Pleuroscopy Findings:*\n- Rigid 7mm pleuroscope (0-degree) introduced\n- Systematic examination of all pleural surfaces\n- **Visceral Pleura:** Multiple small (2-6 mm) white nodules scattered across visceral surface, particularly dense over middle and lower lobes. Approximately 30-40 nodules visualized.\n- **Parietal Pleura:** Extensive parietal pleural involvement with nodular studding. Nodules ranging 5-20 mm, some confluent. Posterolateral and diaphragmatic involvement prominent.\n- **Diaphragm:** Multiple nodular implants on diaphragmatic surface\n- **Mediastinum:** Mediastinal pleura with scattered nodules\n- **Lung:** Lung expansion adequate but with areas of pleural tethering\n- **Overall Impression:** Extensive pleural metastases consistent with metastatic breast cancer\n\n*Biopsies:*\n- Multiple biopsies obtained from parietal pleura (8 specimens) - largest nodules targeted\n- 4 biopsies from visceral pleura\n- Optical biopsy forceps used\n- Adequate tissue depth obtained\n- Excellent hemostasis maintained\n- Specimens placed in formalin\n- Additional specimens sent for ER/PR/HER2 testing\n\n*Therapeutic Consideration:*\n- Given extensive disease burden and good lung expansion, talc pleurodesis discussed\n- Patient consented to pleurodesis\n- Complete fluid evacuation: total 1,450 mL hemorrhagic fluid\n- 5 grams sterile talc insufflated throughout pleural space\n- Uniform distribution under direct visualization\n- 28 French chest tube placed under direct vision\n- Chest tube secured with 1-0 silk suture\n\n*Complications During Procedure:* \n- Brief desaturation to 88% during fluid drainage, resolved with supplemental O2 increase\n- No other complications\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Patient recovered well in PACU\n- Chest tube to water seal, -20 cm H2O suction\n- Post-procedure chest X-ray: chest tube appropriately positioned, talc visible, small residual effusion, no pneumothorax\n- Oxygen requirement: 3L NC, SpO2 94%\n- Vital signs: BP 118/72, HR 88, SpO2 94% on 3L NC\n- Pain controlled with IV hydromorphone transitioning to PO oxycodone\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural biopsies (12 specimens) - histopathology\n- Pleural biopsies - ER/PR/HER2 immunohistochemistry\n- Pleural fluid - cytology, cell block\n\n**IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT:**\nSuccessful medical pleuroscopy confirming extensive metastatic pleural disease consistent with breast cancer recurrence. Talc pleurodesis performed. Adequate tissue obtained for diagnosis and receptor studies.\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** \n- Minor: Transient hypoxemia during procedure, resolved with increased FiO2\n\n**DISPOSITION:** \nAdmitted to pulmonary service for post-procedure care\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Chest tube management with water seal after 24 hours if clinically stable\n- Monitor for post-pleurodesis inflammatory response (fever common)\n- Scheduled acetaminophen and ibuprofen\n- Pain management per protocol\n- Daily chest X-rays\n- Chest tube removal criteria: output <150 mL/24h, no air leak, good lung expansion\n- Oncology consultation for systemic therapy planning\n- Tumor board presentation for treatment recommendations\n- Follow up with interventional pulmonology 2-3 weeks post-discharge\n- Consideration for IPC if pleurodesis fails"
