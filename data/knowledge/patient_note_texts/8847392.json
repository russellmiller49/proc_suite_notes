Under moderate sedation, a linear EBUS bronchoscope was introduced. A systematic evaluation of the mediastinum was conducted. Station 2R was id[REDACTED] (24mm) and sampled with a 22G needle; ROSE indicated atypia. Station 4R (31mm) demonstrated distinct malignant features and was sampled; cytology confirmed adenocarcinoma.

We began by surveying the mediastinum. We located Station 2R, which appeared heterogeneous, and performed five needle passes, yielding atypical cells. Moving to Station 4R, the ultrasound showed a hypoechoic center; four passes confirmed adenocarcinoma. Station 7 was also sampled three times, showing benign tissue.
