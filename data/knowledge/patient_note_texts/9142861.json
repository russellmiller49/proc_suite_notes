ETT secured in good position.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\nTrachea normal caliber, carina sharp. Bilateral airways inspected to subsegmental level. No endobronchial lesions. Minimal secretions cleared.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nPCV\t12\t369\t9\t80\t6\t20\n\nThe single-use disposable Noah Galaxy bronchoscope was introduced into the airway. Navigational registration was performed using the electromagnetic field generator placed beneath the patient.\n\nThe scope was navigated to the approximate target location in the RLL (RB7) based on the pre-operative CT navigational plan. Registration accuracy: 2.7mm.\n\nFluoroscopic guidance used to confirm scope position relative to target. Navigation alignment confirmed.\n\nRadial EBUS performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration performed with 22G needle. 6 passes obtained. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial forceps biopsy performed. 4 specimens obtained under fluoroscopic guidance with TiLT overlay. Samples sent for Surgical Pathology.\n\nCytology brushings obtained. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage performed at target segment. 40mL instilled, 16mL return. Sent for Cytology and Culture.\n\nGold fiducial marker placed under TiLT-augmented fluoroscopic guidance for SBRT planning.\n\nROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma\n\nFinal airway inspection performed - no significant bleeding or complications. The disposable Galaxy scope was removed and discarded at the end of the case.\n\nPatient [REDACTED] well. No immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, post-procedure CXR, discharge if stable.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nLee, MD"
