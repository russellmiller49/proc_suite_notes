  "9308712": "Nancy Reyes, MRN [REDACTED], a 64-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Baptist Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was combined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis with a 27.5mm ground-glass lesion in the RLL superior (B6), bronchus sign negative, PET SUV max 16.3. The patient was ASA class 4 with smoking history of 34 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 22-gauge Acquire needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 11R (22.0mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma); station 4R (13.7mm, 4 passes, ROSE: Atypical cells); station 11L (18.9mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy system (Noah Medical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 2.8mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL superior (B6) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed eccentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by cbct. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (4 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 100 minutes. Attending physician: Steven Park, MD."
