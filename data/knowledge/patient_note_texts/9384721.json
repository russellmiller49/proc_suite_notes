We drained over a liter of fluid and saw several nodules on the lining of her lung, which we biopsied. Since her lung expanded well after the fluid was gone, we sprayed medical talc into the space to seal it and prevent the fluid from coming back. We left a chest tube in place to help the lung heal and admitted her to the hospital.",
