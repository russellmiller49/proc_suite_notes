Patient id[REDACTED] confirmed with two id[REDACTED]\n2. Informed consent verified on chart\n3. NPO status confirmed (>8 hours)\n4. Anticoagulation status reviewed - not on anticoagulation\n5. Allergies reviewed - NKDA\n6. Time-out performed with all team members\n\nINDICATION:\nPET-avid lung mass and mediastinal lymphadenopathy\nTarget lesion: 23.3mm solid nodule, RLL medial basal (B7)\nBronchus sign: Negative\n\nANESTHESIA:\nType: General anesthesia\nAirway: 8.0mm ETT, oral\nInduction: Standard IV induction by anesthesia team\n\nEQUIPMENT USED:\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: 22G Standard FNA\n- Robotic platform: Galaxy (Noah Medical)\n- Radial EBUS: 20 MHz miniprobe\n- Biopsy forceps: Standard\n- Cytology brushes: Standard\n\nPROCEDURE STEPS:\n\nPART A - LINEAR EBUS FOR STAGING:\n1. Bronchoscope inserted through ETT\n2. Standard airway inspection performed - airways patent, no endobronchial lesions\n3. Linear EBUS scope exchanged\n4. Systematic lymph node survey performed\n5. Following stations id[REDACTED] and sampled:\n   - Station 2R: 12.0mm, 4 passes\n   - Station 10R: 12.9mm, 3 passes\n   - Station 2L: 13.9mm, 2 passes\n\n6. ROSE performed - cytopathologist present\n7. ROSE results: Malignant - NSCLC NOS\n\nPART B - ROBOTIC NAVIGATION:\n1. Galaxy system prepared and registered\n2. Registration error: 1.9mm (acceptable)\n3. Robotic catheter advanced to RLL medial basal (B7)\n4. Radial EBUS deployed - Adjacent view obtained\n5. Tool-in-lesion confirmed with Radial EBUS\n6. Sampling performed:\n   - Forceps biopsies: 5\n   - TBNA passes: 4\n   - Brushings: 2\n7. ROSE performed - Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n8. BAL obtained from RLL\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE:\n1. Airways inspected - no active bleeding\n2. Bronchoscope removed\n3. Patient extubated without difficulty\n4. Post-procedure CXR ordered - no pneumothorax\n5. Patient to recovery area\n\nSPECIMENS SENT:\n1. EBUS-TBNA (stations 2R, 10R, 2L) → Cytology, cell block\n2. TBBx RLL → Surgical pathology\n3. Brushings → Cytology\n4. BAL → Cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: <10 mL\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1. Completed EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging\n2. Completed robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. No immediate complications\n\nPLAN:\n1. Monitor in recovery x 2 hours\n2. Discharge home if stable\n3. Follow-up in clinic for pathology results\n4. Results to be discussed at tumor board\n\nProcedure performed under direct supervision of David Kim, MD\n\nJessica Martinez, PGY-5\nDavid Kim, MD (Attending - present for entire procedure)"
