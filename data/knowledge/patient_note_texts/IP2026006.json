Visualization confirmed diffuse tumor implants and significant lung entrapment. Talc poudrage was performed. Due to the trapped lung physiology, a decision was made to place an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter to ensure effective long-term palliation. The catheter was tunneled and secured without complication.",

General anesthesia was induced and maintained with inhaled agents and IV opioids. Single-lung ventilation of the left lung was used during the thoracoscopic portion.\nUltrasound id[REDACTED] a moderate right pleural effusion and a safe entry site in the 6th intercostal space at the midaxillary line. After sterile prep and local anesthetic, a trocar was inserted with return of serosanguinous fluid. Approximately 2000 mL were drained.\nThoracoscopic inspection showed diffuse parietal pleural tumor implants and a trapped right lower lobe. Multiple biopsies of parietal pleura were obtained. Four grams of sterile talc were insufflated evenly for poudrage pleurodesis. Because of trapped lung and anticipated ongoing fluid production, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was placed through a separate anterior chest wall tunnel and exited at the right anterior axillary line. The catheter was secured, connected to suction, and then capped.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: ~25 mL\nDISPOSITION: Discharged to home later the same day with tunneled pleural catheter in place and home health arranged for drainage.\nIMPRESSION/PLAN: Medical thoracoscopy with pleural biopsies, talc pleurodesis, and tunneled pleural catheter placement for recurrent malignant effusion with trapped lung. Initiate home drainage three times weekly, adjust based on output. Oncology follow-up as scheduled."
