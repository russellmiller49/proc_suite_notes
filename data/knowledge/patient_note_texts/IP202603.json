Sonographic evaluation id[REDACTED] enlargement of subcarinal (7) and paratracheal (4R, 4L) stations. Systematic sampling was performed with 5 passes per station using 22G and 19G needles. ROSE evaluation of station 4R demonstrated granulomatous inflammation. The procedure was concluded without incident.",

After inserting the LMA, we used the convex probe to locate nodes at stations 7, 4R, and 4L. We thoroughly sampled all three stations with multiple needle passes. Preliminary results from the 4R node indicate granulomatous disease.",
