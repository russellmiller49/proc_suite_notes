  "IP202604_syn_2": "PROCEDURE: EBUS-TBNA for staging and molecular profiling.\nFINDINGS: The airway was inspected via LMA and found to be normal. EBUS examination revealed an enlarged station 4R node (8.4mm), which was not sampled. Station 11R was id[REDACTED] and sampled via transbronchial needle aspiration (22G needle, 7 passes) to ensure adequate cellularity for molecular testing. ROSE confirmed adenocarcinoma.",
  "IP202604_syn_3": "Code: 31652 (EBUS-TBNA 1-2 stations).\nRationale: Only one station (11R) was sampled. Station 4R was imaged/measured but not aspirated, therefore it does not count toward the 31653 threshold.\nPathology: Adenocarcinoma confirmed on site.",
