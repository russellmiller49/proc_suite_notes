Examination revealed diffuse, erythematous tracheobronchitis accompanied by tenacious, yellow mucous plugging throughout the bronchial tree. Therapeutic aspiration was performed, systematically clearing these secretions from the segmental bronchi. A bronchial wash was obtained from the right lower lobe lateral segment for microbiological analysis. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
