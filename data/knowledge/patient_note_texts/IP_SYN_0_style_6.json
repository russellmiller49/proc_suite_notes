Upon entering the trachea mild tracheomalacia was noted along with diffuse tracheobronchitis and thick yellow mucous plugs extending throughout the right and left bronchial trees. Therapeutic aspiration was performed to remove these mucous plugs. Inspection was performed to the subsegmental level. A bronchial wash was performed in the RLL lateral segment. No lesions were seen. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication."
