  "IP_SYN_0_style_8": "The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite for evaluation of a right lower lobe obstruction. After the administration of local anesthesia and conscious sedation, the bronchoscope was navigated through the upper airway. We observed mild tracheomalacia and significant inflammation consistent with tracheobronchitis. Thick, yellow mucous plugs were visualized throughout the bronchial tree. We proceeded to suction these plugs to clear the airways. A specific wash was collected from the right lower lobe. The procedure concluded without adverse events."
