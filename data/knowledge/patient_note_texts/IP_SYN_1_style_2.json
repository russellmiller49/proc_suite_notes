  "IP_SYN_1_style_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient presented with airway obstruction secondary to a migrated esophageal stent. Under general anesthesia, rigid bronchoscopy was utilized. The esophageal prosthesis was found protruding into the distal trachea and occluding the left mainstem. Using rigid forceps and optical scissors, the foreign body was disassembled and extracted piecemeal to relieve the obstruction (CPT 31635). Examination revealed a significant tracheoesophageal fistula. To manage the airway and fistula, a Dynamic Y-stent was deployed, stenting the trachea and bilateral mainstems (CPT 31636, 31637). The airway was secured with an endotracheal tube post-deployment."
