  "IP_SYN_1_style_5": "Patient [REDACTED] a migrated esophageal stent in the airway causing obstruction so we went to the OR for rigid bronchoscopy. Under GA we saw the stent sticking into the trachea and blocking the left side. We used the rigid scope and forceps to pull the stent out it broke apart so we had to take it out in pieces. There was a big hole between the trachea and esophagus so we put in a Y stent to cover it. It was hard to place but we got it in eventually. Intubated through the stent at the end."
