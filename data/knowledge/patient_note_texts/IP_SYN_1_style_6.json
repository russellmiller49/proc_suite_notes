  "IP_SYN_1_style_6": "Under general anesthesia a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope visualized an esophageal stent protruding into the distal trachea and left mainstem. A 14mm rigid bronchoscope was inserted. The foreign body was removed piecemeal using forceps and scissors. Following removal a large tracheoesophageal fistula was evident. A 13x10x10mm Dynamic Y-stent was deployed to bridge the defect and maintain airway patency involving the trachea and both mainstem bronchi. An ETT was placed through the stent for ventilation."
