  "IP_SYN_1_style_8": "We performed a complex airway intervention for a patient with a migrated esophageal stent. Upon inspection, the stent was found compromising the distal trachea and left mainstem. We utilized rigid bronchoscopy to carefully extract the stent fragments and associated clips. This process revealed a significant tracheoesophageal fistula. To restore airway integrity and cover the defect, we deployed a silicone Y-stent, ensuring limbs were seated in the right and left mainstems. The patient was intubated through the stent for post-op management."
