  "IP_SYN_1_var_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite for evaluation of a left upper lobe pulmonary nodule. Following the induction of general anesthesia, a comprehensive airway inspection revealed normal anatomy barring a fused LUL anterior segment. EBUS was utilized for mediastinal staging; station 4R met sampling criteria and was aspirated without cytologic evidence of malignancy. Attention was then turned to the parenchymal lesion. Utilizing radial EBUS, an eccentric acoustic signal was obtained in the anterior segment of the LUL. Diagnostic sampling via brush and forceps was performed. Subsequently, in accordance with the DECAMP protocol, research specimens were procured from the RUL, RML, and LUL. Hemostasis was assured."
