  "IP_SYN_1_var_6": "The patient arrived for EBUS bronchoscopy regarding a pulmonary nodule. General anesthesia was used. We inserted the Q190 and saw a fused anterior segment in the LUL but otherwise normal anatomy. We switched to the EBUS scope. Station 4R was 5mm and was sampled; cytology was negative. We switched to the thin scope P190. We went to the LUL nodule, found it with radial EBUS (eccentric), and biopsied it. ROSE was negative. We then did the DECAMP research biopsies in the RUL, RML, and LUL. No bleeding. Patient stable."
