  "IP_SYN_1_var_8": "The patient underwent an EBUS bronchoscopy under general anesthesia for a pulmonary nodule. Initial inspection showed a fused anterior segment of the left upper lobe. We proceeded with EBUS-TBNA of station 4R, which was negative on onsite evaluation. We then navigated to the LUL nodule using radial EBUS, obtaining an eccentric view. Biopsies were taken with forceps and brush; preliminary results were negative. Research samples were then collected from the RUL, RML, and LUL per the DECAMP protocol. The procedure was well tolerated."
