  "IP_SYN_2_style_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis presented for therapeutic whole lung lavage. Following induction of general anesthesia, a left-sided double-lumen tube was placed and position verified bronchoscopically to ensure lung isolation. We proceeded with large-volume lavage of the left lung using warm saline in 1-liter aliquots. Percussion was applied to facilitate clearance. A total of 8 liters was instilled with excellent clearing of the proteinaceous effluent. The patient was extubated and transferred to the ICU."
