  "IP_SYN_2_style_5": "Procedure note for whole lung lavage on the left side patient has PAP. We put in a double lumen tube checked it with the scope. Started running warm saline into the left lung 1 liter at a time. Fluid came out really milky at first. We did chest percussion. After about 8 liters the fluid looked clear so we stopped. Patient woke up a bit wild and hypoxic so we sent them to the ICU instead of the floor."
