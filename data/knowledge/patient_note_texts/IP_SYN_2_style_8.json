  "IP_SYN_2_style_8": "The patient underwent a left whole lung lavage for symptomatic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. We secured the airway with a double-lumen tube to isolate the lungs. We then systematically lavaged the left lung with warm saline, utilizing chest percussion to mobilize the sediment. Initial returns were opaque, but after 8 liters of lavage, the fluid ran clear. We concluded the procedure and transferred the patient to the intensive care unit for post-anesthesia recovery."
