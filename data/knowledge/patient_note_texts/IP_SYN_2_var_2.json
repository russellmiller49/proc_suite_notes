  "IP_SYN_2_var_2": "PROCEDURE: Diagnostic and Staging Bronchoscopy.\nFINDINGS: A glistening, hypervascular endobronchial lesion was id[REDACTED] in the lateral segment of the RML. Due to its friable nature, needle aspiration was performed first, followed by hemostatic control with tranexamic acid. Subsequent EBUS evaluation of stations 4L, 4R, 7, and 11R yielded benign lymphocytes. Following staging, therapeutic bronchoscopy was utilized to obtain forceps biopsies of the RML mass. Moderate hemorrhage ensued, necessitating mechanical tamponade for control."
