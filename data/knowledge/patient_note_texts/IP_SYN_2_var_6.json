  "IP_SYN_2_var_6": "Under MAC anesthesia we performed a bronchoscopy. A vascular tumor was seen in the RML lateral segment. We performed 6 needle biopsies. Bleeding occurred and was treated with 4ml of TXA. We then switched to EBUS and sampled nodes 4L, 7, 4R, and 11R; all were negative. We switched to a therapeutic scope and performed 5 forceps biopsies of the RML lesion. Moderate bleeding required tamponade. The procedure was concluded once hemostasis was secure."
