  "IP_SYN_2_var_8": "The patient underwent bronchoscopy for a right middle lobe nodule. Upon inspection, a vascular, friable tumor was seen obstructing the RML lateral segment. We performed endobronchial needle aspiration initially to minimize trauma, using tranexamic acid to control subsequent oozing. We then proceeded to stage the mediastinum using EBUS, sampling stations 4L, 4R, 7, and 11R, all of which were benign. Returning to the RML with a therapeutic scope, we obtained forceps biopsies. This resulted in moderate bleeding managed successfully with mechanical tamponade."
