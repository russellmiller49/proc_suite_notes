  "IP_SYN_3_style_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient, a pediatric male with a mediastinal mass, presented for airway stent management. Under general anesthesia, bronchoscopy revealed granulation tissue partially obstructing the left mainstem limb of the Y-stent. A rigid bronchoscope was utilized to grasp and extract the Y-stent intact (Foreign Body Removal). Following stent removal, flexible cryotherapy was applied to the residual granulation tissue in the left mainstem to destroy the obstruction (Destruction of Tumor/Stenosis). The airway was patent at the conclusion."
