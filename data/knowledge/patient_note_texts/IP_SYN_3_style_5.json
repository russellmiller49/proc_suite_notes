  "IP_SYN_3_style_5": "Patient is a kid with a Y stent that has granulation tissue blocking it. We did this in the OR with general anesthesia. Went in with the flex scope saw the tissue. Switched to rigid scope grabbed the stent and pulled it out spinning it a bit it came out whole. Then went back with the flex scope and used the cryo probe to freeze the granulation tissue in the left mainstem. No bleeding everything looks okay."
