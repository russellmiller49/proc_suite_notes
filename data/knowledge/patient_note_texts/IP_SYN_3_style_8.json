  "IP_SYN_3_style_8": "We performed a combined rigid and flexible bronchoscopy to manage this patient's airway stent. The Y-stent was found to be obstructed by granulation tissue in the left mainstem. We successfully extracted the stent using rigid instrumentation. Once the stent was out, we treated the underlying granulation tissue with cryotherapy to open the airway further. The patient remained stable and was transferred to the pediatric unit."
