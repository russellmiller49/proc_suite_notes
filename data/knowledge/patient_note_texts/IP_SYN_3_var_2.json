EBUS-TBNA was performed on enlarged lymph nodes at stations 4R, 7, and 4L; rapid on-site evaluation demonstrated benign lymphoid tissue. Following the staging component, the bronchoscope was re-inserted. Under fluoroscopic guidance, transbronchial forceps biopsies were obtained from the right middle and right lower lobes to evaluate the interstitial process. A bronchoalveolar lavage was also completed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
