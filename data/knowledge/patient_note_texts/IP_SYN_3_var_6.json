  "IP_SYN_3_var_6": "The procedure was EBUS bronchoscopy with TBBx and BAL. Indications were adenopathy and ILD. Using the Q190, the airway was normal. EBUS was used to sample 4R, 7, and 4L; all were benign. We then performed fluoroscopically guided transbronchial biopsies in the RML and RLL. A BAL was performed with 40cc return. No complications occurred."
