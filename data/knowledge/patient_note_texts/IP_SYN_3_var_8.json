  "IP_SYN_3_var_8": "We performed an EBUS bronchoscopy to investigate mediastinal adenopathy and interstitial lung disease. The airway exam was unremarkable. We utilized the convex probe EBUS to sample lymph nodes at stations 4R, 7, and 4L. On-site pathology showed benign lymphoid tissue. We then switched to a video bronchoscope to perform transbronchial biopsies in the right middle and lower lobes under fluoroscopic guidance. A bronchoalveolar lavage was also performed. There were no immediate complications."
