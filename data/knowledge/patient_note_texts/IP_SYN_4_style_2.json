  "IP_SYN_4_style_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient with severe tracheobronchomalacia presented with stent obstruction. Rigid bronchoscopy was performed. Initially, copious purulent secretions were aspirated from the lower lobes to clear the airway (Therapeutic Aspiration). The indwelling Y-stent was then grasped and removed intact via the rigid scope (Foreign Body Removal). Inspection revealed granulation tissue causing stenosis in the bilateral mainstems, which was treated with cryotherapy (Destruction of Stenosis). Significant dynamic collapse was noted post-removal."
