  "IP_SYN_4_style_5": "Procedure note for stent removal. Patient has TBM and the stent was getting blocked. We put them under GA used the rigid scope. First we had to suck out a ton of pus from the lower lobes it was really thick. Then we grabbed the stent and pulled it out. There was granulation tissue on both sides so we froze it with the cryo probe. Airway collapses a lot without the stent but we are doing a holiday."
