  "IP_SYN_4_style_8": "We brought the patient to the OR to manage an obstructed airway stent. Using the rigid bronchoscope, we first cleared significant purulent secretions from the distal airways. We then successfully removed the Y-stent. To address the stenosis caused by granulation tissue at the stent ends, we applied cryotherapy. The airway showed marked collapse consistent with the underlying malacia. We plan to observe the patient without the stent for now."
