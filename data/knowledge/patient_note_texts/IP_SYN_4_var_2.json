  "IP_SYN_4_var_2": "PROCEDURE: Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy (ENB).\nINDICATION: Right upper lobe pulmonary nodule.\nNARRATIVE: Following induction, a diagnostic inspection revealed normal anatomy. The SuperDimension navigation catheter was advanced into the anterior segment of the RUL, achieving position within 1cm of the target. Radial EBUS confirmation yielded a concentric signal. Transbronchial needle aspiration and forceps biopsies were performed under fluoroscopic guidance. ROSE indicated inflammatory cells. Post-procedural fluoroscopy ruled out pneumothorax."
