  "IP_SYN_5_var_2": "OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient underwent peripheral bronchoscopy for a suspicious pulmonary nodule. Airway inspection revealed a fused left upper lobe anterior segment and lingula. The therapeutic bronchoscope was utilized to advance a sheath and radial EBUS probe to the target, revealing a concentric orientation. Transbronchial needle aspiration was diagnostic for malignancy on rapid on-site evaluation. Six additional forceps biopsies were obtained for characterization. Hemostasis was achieved."
