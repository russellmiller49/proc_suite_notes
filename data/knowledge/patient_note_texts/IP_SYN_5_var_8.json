  "IP_SYN_5_var_8": "We performed a peripheral bronchoscopy to diagnose a pulmonary nodule. The patient's anatomy showed a fused left upper lobe and lingula. We navigated a sheath to the lesion and confirmed its location with radial EBUS, obtaining a concentric view. Needle biopsies were immediately diagnostic for malignancy. We proceeded to take six forceps biopsies to ensure adequate tissue for profiling. The procedure concluded without complications."
