  "MRN-1_syn_2": "PROCEDURE: Flexible Bronchoscopy with Tracheal Dilation.\nINDICATION: Post-intubation tracheal stenosis.\nNARRATIVE: The airway was inspected, revealing a concentric stenotic segment in the mid-trachea reducing the lumen to approximately 40%. Serial balloon dilations were performed using a CRE balloon, achieving a final patency of 75%. No significant mucosal trauma was noted.\nIMPRESSION: Improved tracheal caliber.",

  "MRN-1_syn_8": "We performed a flexible bronchoscopy to treat the patient's tracheal narrowing. The stenosis was significant, blocking about 60% of the airway. We used a balloon catheter to gently stretch the scar tissue in multiple steps. By the end of the procedure, the airway was much more open, with about 75% patency. The patient tolerated the dilation well.",
  "MRN-1_syn_9": "Procedure: Endoscopic tracheal expansion.\nIssue: Cicatricial airway stenosis.\nAction: The stricture was radially expanded using a pneumatic dilator. Serial inflations were executed.\nResult: Augmented tracheal cross-section."
