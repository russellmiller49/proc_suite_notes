  "MRN-9_syn_2": "PROCEDURE: Diagnostic Flexible Bronchoscopy with Bronchoalveolar Lavage.\nINDICATION: Evaluation of non-resolving pneumonia.\nNARRATIVE: The tracheobronchial tree was inspected and found to be patent with no endobronchial lesions. The bronchoscope was wedged in a segment of the left lower lobe. 100mL of saline was instilled and aspirated. The return was cloudy and sent for analysis.\nIMPRESSION: Presumed infectious pneumonia.",
