EBUS bronchoscope inserted via ETT. Initial inspection showed normal trachea, sharp carina. Systematic ultrasound examination:\nLymph node stations evaluated: → 2R: 11mm, normal echogenicity → 4R: 31mm, ENLARGED, loss of normal architecture → 4L: 24mm, ENLARGED, hypoechoic\n→ 7: 42mm, MARKEDLY ENLARGED, heterogeneous → 10R: 18mm, prominent → 10L: 16mm, prominent → 11R: 21mm, abnormal appearance\nTBNA sampling:\nStation 7 (42mm) Needle: 22G Pass 1 @ 0758 - visible tissue core Pass 2 @ 0801 - additional sample Pass 3 @ 0803 - for molecular studies Pass 4 @ 0805 - microbiology ROSE Result: MALIGNANT, small cell morphology id[REDACTED]\nStation 4R (31mm) 3 passes performed ROSE: Small cell carcinoma confirmed\nStation 4L (24mm) 3 passes performed\nROSE: Malignant cells present\nStation 10R (18mm) 2 passes performed ROSE: Atypical cells\nProcedure completed 0822 Total time: 37 minutes EBL: <5mL Patient extubated, to recovery in stable condition\nPreliminary findings: Extensive N2/N3 disease confirmed Specimens to pathology: Cytology, cell block, molecular testing\nPatient [REDACTED]-procedure regarding findings\nNext steps: Oncology consult, PET-CT for full staging\nSigned: Dr. Anjali Pat tel, MD, FCCP Time: [REDACTED] 09:15\n________________________________________\nEBUS\nBRONCHOSCOPY PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION Patient: Clark, Sandra M | MRN [REDACTED] | DOB [REDACTED] Date of Procedure: [REDACTED]\nProvider: Elliott, Mark DO | Interventional Pulmonology\nINDICATION: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suspected lymphoma based on PET findings\nINFORMED CONSENT: Obtained, documented in chart\nPROCEDURE: EBUS-TBNA with ROSE\nANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation - Fentanyl 100mcg IV, Midazolam 4mg IV Local - Lidocaine 4% spray, Lidocaine 2% 20cc via working channel\nEQUIPMENT: Olympus EBUS bronchoscope\nTECHNIQUE: EBUS scope introduced through mouth after adequate sedation. Vocal cords normal. Mediastinal ultrasound survey performed with following findings:\nStation 2R: Not enlarged Station 4R: 29mm, ABNORMAL - round, hypoechoic, loss of hilum\nStation 4L: 26mm, ABNORMAL - similar features Station 7: 47mm, MARKEDLY ABNORMAL - huge subcarinal node, diffuse hypoechoic pattern Station 10R: 14mm, mildly enlarged Station 10L: 19mm, enlarged Station 11R: 22mm, ABNORMAL appearance Station 11L: 20mm, ABNORMAL appearance\nSAMPLING DETAILS:\nStation 7 (47x29mm) - SUBCARINAL Pass 1: 22G needle, excellent tissue yield ROSE: Abundant large atypical lymphoid cells, HIGH SUSPICION for lymphoma Pass 2: Additional specimen for flow cytometry Pass 3: Additional specimen for flow cytometry\nPass 4: Cell block preparation\nStation 4R (29x17mm) Pass 1-3: Consistent with Station 7 ROSE: Large atypical lymphoid cells\nStation 4L (26x16mm) Pass 1-2: Sampling performed ROSE: Similar atypical population\nStation 11R (22x13mm) Pass 1-2: Sampling performed ROSE: Atypical lymphoid proliferation\nElastography used on Station 7 showing firm consistency (blue pattern)\nAirways: Bilaterally patent, no endobronchial lesions\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nSPECIMENS: ✓ Cytology from all sampled stations ✓ Flow cytometry - Stations 7, 4R, 4L, 11R ✓ Cell blocks prepared ✓ Cultures sent (Station 7)\nTOLERANCE: Procedure well tolerated, stable hemodynamics, O2 sats >95% throughout\nPRELIMINARY INTERPRETATION: EBUS-TBNA with ROSE findings highly suspicious for lymphoma involving multiple mediastinal and hilar stations (7, 4R, 4L, 11R). Extensive nodal involvement suggesting advanced stage.\nPLAN:\n1.\tHematology-Oncology urgent consultation\n2.\tFinal pathology with flow cytometry results in 3-5 days\n3.\tStaging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis\n4.\tBone marrow biopsy may be indicated\n5.\tF/U IP clinic 1 week\nMark Elliott, DO Interventional Pulmonology Signed: [REDACTED] 15:41\n________________________________________\nEBUS"
