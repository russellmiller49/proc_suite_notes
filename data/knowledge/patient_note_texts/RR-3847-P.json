Transbronchial needle aspiration of stations 2R, 4R, 7, and 10R was performed. Cytopathology confirmed malignancy in the mediastinal stations. Subsequently, the RUL endobronchial component was interrogated, revealing partial obstruction. Forceps biopsies and brushings were obtained.\nIMPRESSION: Stage IIIB Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma.",
