  "S31640-018_syn_1": "Indication: Benign tracheal stenosis.\nProc: Flex bronch, mechanical debulking.\nFindings: 65% stenosis mid-trachea (scar/granulation).\nAction: Forceps removal, snare of fibrotic ridge.\nNo balloon, no ablation.\nResult: Mild residual narrowing.",
  "S31640-018_syn_2": "PROCEDURE: Bronchoscopic management of benign tracheal stenosis.\nFINDINGS: Post-intubation scarring and granulation tissue narrowing the mid-trachea.\nTECHNIQUE: Mechanical excision was performed. Granulation tissue was avulsed using biopsy forceps. A distinct fibrotic ridge was resected using an electrosurgical snare. No balloon dilation or thermal ablation was required to achieve satisfactory patency.",
  "S31640-018_syn_3": "Billing Code: 31640.\nDiagnosis: Benign Tracheal Stenosis.\nTechnique: Excision of tracheal tissue (scar/granulation) using forceps and snare.\nNote: This is coded as excision (31640) rather than dilation (31630) or ablation (31641) because the primary method was removal of tissue.",
  "S31640-018_syn_4": "Procedure: Tracheal Debulking\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nSteps:\n1. Moderate sedation.\n2. Scope inserted.\n3. Scar tissue seen in trachea.\n4. Used forceps to grab granulation.\n5. Snared a ridge of scar.\n6. Airway looks better.\nPlan: Home.",
  "S31640-018_syn_5": "Laura Perez here for that tracheal scar from her breathing tube last year. Went in with the flex scope. Saw the narrowing about 65 percent. Used forceps to pick away the granulation and a snare to cut the scar band. Didn't use a balloon this time just mechanical removal. Bleeding was minimal. She can go home.",
  "S31640-018_syn_6": "Flexible bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of granulation tissue and scar. Benign post-intubation tracheal stenosis. Short-segment circumferential granulation in mid-trachea narrowing lumen by 65%. Mechanical debulking done with forceps to remove granulation tissue. Snare resection of fibrotic ridge. No balloon dilation or ablation. Tracheal lumen improved.",
  "S31640-018_syn_7": "[Indication]\nBenign tracheal stenosis, dyspnea.\n[Anesthesia]\nModerate sedation.\n[Description]\n65% mid-tracheal narrowing. Mechanical excision using forceps and snare. No balloon/ablation.\n[Plan]\nDischarge, monitor for restenosis.",
  "S31640-018_syn_8": "[REDACTED] in her trachea from a previous intubation. We went in with a bronchoscope and found the scar tissue narrowing her airway. We used small forceps to remove the granulation tissue and a snare loop to cut away a ridge of scar. We didn't need to stretch it with a balloon or burn it; simple mechanical removal opened it up nicely.",
  "S31640-018_syn_9": "Procedure: Flexible endoscopy with physical excision of cicatrix.\nIndication: Benign airway constriction.\nAction: Granulation tissue was extracted via grasping tools. A fibrotic band was resected with a wire loop. Neither dilation nor thermal ablation was utilized.\nResult: Lumen caliber improved.",
  "S31640-018": "BRONCHOSCOPY NOTE – MECHANICAL DEBULKING OF BENIGN TRACHEAL STENOSIS\n\nPatient: [REDACTED], 44-year-old female\nMRN: [REDACTED]\nDate: [REDACTED]\nLocation: [REDACTED]\nAttending: Dr. Henry Wallace\n\nIndication:\nBenign post-intubation tracheal stenosis with exertional dyspnea.\n\nProcedure:\nFlexible bronchoscopy with mechanical debulking of granulation tissue and scar (CPT 31640).\n\nAnesthesia / Sedation:\nModerate sedation with midazolam and fentanyl, topical lidocaine. Native airway. ASA class II.\n\nFindings:\nShort-segment circumferential granulation and scar in mid-trachea narrowing lumen by ~65%.\n\nInterventions:\nMechanical debulking done with forceps to remove granulation tissue; snare resection of a fibrotic ridge. No balloon dilation, no ablation. Tracheal lumen improved to mild residual narrowing.\n\nHemostasis:\nMinimal oozing controlled with cold saline.\n\nEBL:\n5 mL.\n\nComplications:\nNone.\n\nDisposition:\nDischarged home after observation; plan for repeat bronchoscopy and possible balloon dilation in future if restenosis occurs."
