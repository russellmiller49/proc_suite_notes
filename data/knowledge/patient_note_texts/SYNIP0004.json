  "SYNIP0004_syn_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: [REDACTED] severe dyspnea secondary to contiguous obstruction of the left mainstem and left lower lobe bronchi. Under general anesthesia, the airway was secured. Significant tumor burden was noted. Following mechanical debulking and balloon dilation, a 12 x 40 mm metallic stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus (Initial Bronchus). To address the distal extent of the disease, a second 10 x 30 mm metallic stent was deployed in the left lower lobe bronchus (Additional Major Bronchus). Post-procedure inspection showed patent lumens and improved distal aeration.",

Rigid bronchoscopy and fluoroscopy were utilized. Debulking and dilation are included services.",

  "SYNIP0004_syn_5": "Elaine Young here for the left side stents. She had blockage in the mainstem and the lower lobe. We went in cleaned it out and put two metal stents in. One in the main 12 by 40. One in the lower lobe 10 by 30. They overlap a bit but flow is good. Bleeding stopped with ice saline. She is stable going to ICU.",
  "SYNIP0004_syn_6": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT Patient: Elaine Young 61/F Date: [REDACTED] Indication: Malignant obstruction of left mainstem and left lower lobe bronchus with dyspnea at rest. Procedure: Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with mechanical dilation and placement of stents in left mainstem and left lower lobe bronchus. Anesthesia: General anesthesia with ETT, anesthesia by separate service. Findings: About 85% narrowing of the left mainstem and 80% narrowing at the origin of the left lower lobe bronchus from tumor and extrinsic compression; copious secretions. Intervention: Mechanical debulking with the rigid barrel and suction restored a small lumen. Balloon dilation to 12 mm in the left mainstem followed by deployment of a 12 x 40 mm metallic stent. A second 10 x 30 mm metallic stent was placed in the left lower lobe bronchus as an extension. Final appearance showed <20% residual narrowing and markedly improved ventilation. Complications: Brief bleeding <30 mL, controlled with iced saline; no hypoxia. Disposition: Extubated in OR and discharged to surgical ICU in stable condition.",

  "SYNIP0004_syn_8": "We treated [REDACTED] in her left lung today. The tumor was closing off both the main airway and the lower branch. We cleared some of the tumor and then placed two metal stents connected to each other—one in the main tube and one extending down into the lower lobe. This opened everything up nicely, and she should breathe much easier.",
