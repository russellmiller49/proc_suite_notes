Bronchoscopy revealed significant strictures at both the right and left anastomoses. Both sites were dilated via balloon. A 12 x 30 mm metallic stent was deployed in the right mainstem bronchus (Initial). A second 12 x 30 mm metallic stent was deployed in the left mainstem bronchus (Additional). Fluoroscopy confirmed symmetric expansion and proper placement of both prostheses.\nDISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the CT-ICU.",

Procedure: Flexible bronchoscopy with balloon dilation and bilateral bronchial stent placement (right and left mainstem). Anesthesia: General anesthesia with ETT; anesthesia team present. Findings: Approximately 60–70% concentric narrowing at both right and left mainstem bronchial anastomoses; no mass; mild mucus plugging. Intervention: Balloon dilation to 10 and 12 mm was performed at each anastomosis. A 12 x 30 mm metallic stent was deployed in the right mainstem (initial bronchus), followed by placement of a 12 x 30 mm metallic stent in the left mainstem as an additional major bronchus.
