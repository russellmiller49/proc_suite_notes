  "SYN_015_0_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: RIGID BRONCHOSCOPY AND PALLIATIVE RECANALIZATION.\nThe patient, presenting with advanced esophageal carcinoma complicated by a tracheoesophageal fistula, underwent therapeutic intervention. Under general anesthesia, initial inspection revealed significant extrinsic compression of the right mainstem and direct endobronchial invasion of the left mainstem with an associated fistulous tract. Employing a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope, we performed mechanical debulking and thermal ablation via Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) to restore luminal patency. Subsequently, a customized Silicone Y-stent was precisely deployed to stent the carina, successfully excluding the fistula and stabilizing the compromised airways."
