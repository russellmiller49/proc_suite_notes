  "SYN_015_0_6": "The patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and placed under general anesthesia. Initial flexible inspection via LMA revealed a large esophageal tumor invading the left mainstem bronchus with a visible TE fistula and extrinsic compression of the right mainstem. We transitioned to a 12mm rigid bronchoscope. Biopsies were taken, followed by APC cautery and mechanical debulking of the left mainstem lesion. A silicone Y-stent was customized and deployed to cover the fistula and open both mainstems. Post-deployment inspection showed excellent stent position and patent airways."
