  "SYN_015_0_8": "The patient presented with esophageal cancer and a suspected TE fistula. We proceeded with a rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Upon entering the airway, we noted a significant mass in the proximal left mainstem and a small fistula near the carina. We utilized Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) to debulk the tumor and control bleeding. To manage the fistula and the extrinsic compression on the right side, we deployed a silicone Y-stent. The stent was successfully seated, covering the fistula and maintaining patency in both mainstem bronchi."
