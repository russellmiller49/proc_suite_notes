  "SYN_015_1_2": "OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient presented with complete bilobar collapse of the left lung. Under general anesthesia, flexible bronchoscopy revealed vascular endobronchial lesions obstructing both the Left Upper Lobe (LUL) and Left Lower Lobe (LLL). We employed a multimodal interventional approach. For the LUL, electrocautery snare resection and Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) resulted in complete recanalization. The LLL lesion was more extensive; despite aggressive debulking via cryoextraction and APC, only partial (70%) patency was achieved due to distal tumor infiltration."
