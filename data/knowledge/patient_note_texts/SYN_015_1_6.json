  "SYN_015_1_6": "Flexible bronchoscopy was performed under general anesthesia for left lung collapse. Inspection revealed vascular tumors obstructing both the LUL and LLL. The LUL tumor was resected using an electrocautery snare and APC, achieving complete patency. The LLL tumor was debulked using a combination of snare, cryoextraction, and APC; however, due to extensive distal involvement, only 70% patency was restored. Hemostasis was secured with topical TXA."
