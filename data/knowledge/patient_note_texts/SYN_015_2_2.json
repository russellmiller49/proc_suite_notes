  "SYN_015_2_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient presented with complete malignant stenosis of the Left Mainstem (LMS) bronchus. Rigid bronchoscopy was initiated under general anesthesia. The obstruction was recanalized using a combination of cryoextraction and Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) 'burn and shave' techniques. Due to significant residual tumor burden and the risk of re-occlusion, a decision was made to deploy a stent. A 12x40mm Aero Self-Expanding Metallic Stent (SEMS) was positioned under fluoroscopic guidance, achieving >90% luminal patency."
