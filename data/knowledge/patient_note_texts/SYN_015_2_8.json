  "SYN_015_2_8": "We took the patient to the OR for a rigid bronchoscopy to treat a blocked left mainstem bronchus. We removed the bulk of the tumor using a freezing probe (cryo) and cautery (APC). Because there was still some tumor pressing on the airway, we decided to place a stent. We used fluoroscopy to guide a 12x40mm Aero stent into place. This opened the airway up to over 90% of its normal size. The patient is heading to the ICU for recovery."
