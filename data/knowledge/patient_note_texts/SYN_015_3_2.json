  "SYN_015_3_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient presented with a complex obstruction of the Bronchus Intermedius (BI) and Right Upper Lobe (RUL) complicated by post-obstructive pneumonia. Rigid bronchoscopy was utilized. Initial incision with an electrocautery knife released copious purulent material, which was cultured. Mechanical debulking and APC were employed to remove tumor tissue. Subsequent CRE balloon dilation achieved 70% patency in the BI and 85% in the RUL. Stenting was deferred due to extensive distal tumor infiltration."
