  "SYN_015_3_6": "Rigid bronchoscopy was performed for right-sided airway obstruction. Large volume purulent fluid was drained from the distal airways following incision of the tumor in the bronchus intermedius. The tumor was debulked using APC and forceps, followed by CRE balloon dilation. We achieved 70% patency in the BI and 85% in the RUL. Stenting was contraindicated due to distal disease extension. The patient was treated for post-obstructive pneumonia."
