  "SYN_015_3_8": "[REDACTED] a rigid bronchoscopy to clear a tumor blocking his right lung. When we opened the blockage, we found a lot of infection (pus) behind it, which we drained. We used heat (APC) and balloons to widen the airways in the bronchus intermedius and the right upper lobe. We got them mostly open, but we couldn't put a stent in because the tumor goes too far down. We started him on antibiotics for the infection."
