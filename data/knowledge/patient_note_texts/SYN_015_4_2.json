  "SYN_015_4_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy for management of a malignant polypoid obstruction in the Bronchus Intermedius (BI). The lesion was devascularized using the Nd:YAG laser. Mechanical resection was achieved via the 'apple coring' technique using the bevel of the rigid scope. Residual tumor was managed with APC. The RUL orifice was similarly treated. We successfully recanalized the proximal BI to 85%. Stent placement was withheld per patient preference and anatomical constraints."
