  "SYN_015_4_6": "Rigid bronchoscopy was utilized to treat a complete obstruction of the bronchus intermedius. The polypoid lesion was devascularized with Nd:YAG laser and resected using a rigid coring technique. The RUL orifice was also debulked using APC. We achieved 85% patency proximally. Stent placement was deferred based on patient preference and distal tumor anatomy. The patient will follow up with oncology for systemic therapy."
