  "SYN_015_4_8": "We performed a rigid bronchoscopy on [REDACTED] a large tumor blocking his breathing passage. We used a laser to shrink the tumor and then used the metal tube of the scope to core it out. We removed the main chunk of the tumor and used cautery to clean up the rest. The airway is much more open now. We decided against a stent for now, as he prefers to avoid it if possible."
