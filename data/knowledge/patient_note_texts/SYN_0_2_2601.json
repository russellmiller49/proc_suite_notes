  "SYN_0_2_2601": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient, presenting with a known malignant pleural process, underwent ultrasound-guided thoracostomy. Thoracic ultrasonography of the right hemithorax delineated a moderate, free-flowing, anechoic effusion with nodular pleural thickening consistent with metastatic disease. Under local anesthesia and aseptic conditions, a 12 French pigtail catheter was introduced into the right pleural space at the 8th intercostal space utilizing the Seldinger technique. A volume of 450 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was evacuated. The catheter was secured and connected to a Pneumostat valve. The patient tolerated the intervention without hemodynamic compromise."
