  "SYN_0_2_3188": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient presented for evaluation of an indwelling airway stent. Under moderate sedation, a Q190 videobronchoscope was navigated transnasally. The laryngeal structures were unremarkable. Upon tracheal intubation, the Y-stent was visualized in situ. Significant purulence was noted and evacuated. Examination of the distal stent limbs revealed exuberant granulation tissue compromising the lumen (approx. 50% stenosis right, 60% left). Beyond the stenosis, the lower lobar segments contained tenacious purulent secretions which were cleared. Desaturation occurred intraoperatively, necessitating direct intratracheal oxygen insufflation, which corrected the hypoxemia. The procedure concluded without further incident."
