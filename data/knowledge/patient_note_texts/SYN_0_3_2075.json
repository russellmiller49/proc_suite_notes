Y-stent visualized. Significant granulation tissue noted at distal limbs (50% RMS, 60% LMS), but no destruction/excision performed (supports diagnostic only + aspiration). Therapeutic suctioning required for thick secretions in bilateral lower lobes causing hypoxia. Oxygen provided via working channel. Plan for future stent removal."
