  "SYN_0_6_4288": "The procedure was performed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. Following intravenous medications as per the record and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, the Q190 video bronchoscope was introduced through the nose, into the oropharynx. The oropharynx and larynx were well visualized and normal. Topical anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the flexible bronchoscope was then advanced through the larynx into the trachea. The patient’s Y stent was well placed. There was thick purulent mucous throughout the stent which was suctioned. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 50% obstruction and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb there was granulation tissue causing about 60% after bypassing the granulation tissue there were thick copious purulent secretions through the lower lobes which were suctioned. During the procedure, the patient did develop some intermittent hypoxia, requiring attachment of the oxygen supply to the bronchoscope working channel for direct tracheal oxygen administration which resolved the hypoxia. Once we were satisfied that there was no active bleeding, the bronchoscope was removed and the procedure completed."
