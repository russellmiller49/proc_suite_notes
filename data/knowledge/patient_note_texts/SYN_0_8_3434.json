  "SYN_0_8_3434": "The patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite for evaluation of their airway stent. After obtaining consent and administering moderate sedation, we introduced the scope through the nose. The vocal cords were normal. We found the Y-stent in good position but filled with thick, purulent mucus, which we cleared. Inspecting the distal ends, we found granulation tissue obstructing the right limb by 50% and the left by 60%. We navigated past this tissue and found more copious pus in the lower lobes, which was also suctioned. The patient experienced some transient hypoxia during the suctioning, which we managed by administering oxygen directly through the scope channel. The procedure was otherwise uncomplicated."
