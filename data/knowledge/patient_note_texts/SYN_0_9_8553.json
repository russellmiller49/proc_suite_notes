  "SYN_0_9_8553": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe tracheobronchomalacia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Flexible bronchoscopy, diagnostic. INDICATIONS: Airway stent assessment. DESCRIPTION: The procedure was executed in the bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation. The Q190 video bronchoscope was inserted through the nose. The larynx was visualized and normal. The bronchoscope was advanced into the trachea. The Y stent was situated correctly. Thick purulent mucous was aspirated from the stent. At the distal aspect of the right mainstem limb, granulation tissue was occluding about 50% of the lumen, and at the distal aspect of the left mainstem limb, granulation tissue was occluding about 60%. After navigating past the granulation tissue, thick copious purulent secretions were found in the lower lobes and were aspirated. The patient developed intermittent hypoxia, treated with oxygen via the working channel. The bronchoscope was withdrawn."
