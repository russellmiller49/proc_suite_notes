  "SYN_1_2_3317": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient presented with severe tracheobronchomalacia. Initial flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia confirmed near-complete expiratory collapse. A Dynamic Y-stent was initially deployed; however, post-operative imaging revealed proximal migration and inadequate limb length. The patient returned to the operating room for revision. Using a 14mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope, the initial prosthesis was extracted. A customized silicone Dumon Y-stent (18x14x14) was then deployed. Subsequent inspection demonstrated excellent patency and stabilization of the central airways. The patient was extubated and transferred to the ward in stable condition."
