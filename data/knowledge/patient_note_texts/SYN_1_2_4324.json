  "SYN_1_2_4324": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient presented with a complex parapneumonic effusion suggestive of empyema. Thoracic ultrasound of the left hemithorax revealed a moderate, hyperechoic effusion with thickened loculations and pleural thickening. Given the viscosity of the fluid, a larger bore catheter was selected. Under local anesthesia, a 24 French catheter was introduced into the left pleural space via the mid-axillary line at the 4th-5th intercostal space. The procedure yielded 550 mL of turbid, purulent fluid. The catheter was connected to -20 cmH2O suction to facilitate drainage of the infected space."
