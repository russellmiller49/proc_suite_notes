  "SYN_1_8_2209": "The patient underwent bronchoscopy for severe tracheobronchomalacia. Initially, we placed a Dynamic Y-stent, but post-procedure imaging in the PACU revealed it had migrated and the right limb was too short. Therefore, we took the patient back to the OR for revision. Using a rigid bronchoscope, we removed the first stent. We then sized and placed a Dumon silicone Y-stent. This second stent provided excellent stabilization of the airway and resolved the collapse. The patient tolerated the revision well and was transferred to the ward."
