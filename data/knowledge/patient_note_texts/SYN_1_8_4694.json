  "SYN_1_8_4694": "The patient is a 33-year-old male with a complex effusion. We performed a bedside ultrasound which showed a loculated collection on the left side with thick septations. We decided to place a 24 French chest tube to ensure adequate drainage of the thick fluid. After anesthetizing the site with lidocaine, the tube was placed without difficulty. We immediately drained about 550ml of turbid, purulent fluid. The tube was secured and connected to wall suction."
