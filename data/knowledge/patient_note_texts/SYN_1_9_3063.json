INDICATION: Chronic symptoms of TBM. DESCRIPTION: Under general anesthesia, the flexible scope verified severe airway collapse. Purulent secretions were aspirated. A Dynamic Y-stent was positioned. Post-procedure imaging indicated migration. The patient returned to the OR. A rigid bronchoscope was utilized to extract the Dynamic stent. A Dumon Y-stent was then deployed using the Novatech device. The limbs were positioned to stabilize the airway. Final inspection showed resolution of collapse."
