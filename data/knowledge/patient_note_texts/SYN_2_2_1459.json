  "SYN_2_2_1459": "OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient presented with malignant central airway obstruction and a retained metallic stent. Examination revealed significant tumor burden in the right mainstem and granulation/tumor encasing the stent in the left mainstem. A multimodal approach was employed using rigid bronchoscopy. The left-sided metallic stent was liberated using APC, balloon dilation, and mechanical dissection, then extracted. Residual tumor was debulked using cryotherapy and APC. To maintain airway patency, a customized silicone Y-stent was fashioned and deployed, securing ventilation to both lungs. The patient remains intubated for transfer."
