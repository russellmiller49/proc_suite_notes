  "SYN_2_6_8181": "The procedure was performed in the main operating room. Following intravenous medications as per the record a laryngeal mask airway was inserted to ensure the patient could be adequately ventilation. Topical anesthesia was then applied to the upper airway and the Boston Scientific Model B diagnostic disposable video bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth, via laryngeal mask airway and advanced to the tracheobronchial tree. The laryngeal mask airway was in good position. The vocal cords appeared normal. The subglottic space was normal. The proximal trachea was normal. The mid trachea was free of tumor but moderate to severe dynamic collapse was visualized (TBM). The right mainstem was extrinsically compressed from the posterior aspect with additional tumor studding and submucosal disease seen throughout the airway causing approximately 70% obstruction. There were a few small tumor nodules present in the distal trachea mostly on the posterior membrane. The proximal left mainstem was mildly compressed externally with submucosal tumor within the airway wall. In the mid left mainstem there was extensive granulation tissue causing about 75% airway obstruction just proximal to the proximal end of known airway stent. After gently passing the bronchoscope through the area of granulation tissue the stent was visualized with thick purulent mucous throughout. 10cc of bicarbonate solution was instilled to thin secretions and then the secretions were suctioned and cleared. Significant post-obstructive puss was noted distal to the stent primarily originating from the lower lobe bronchus and mini lavage was performed for culture. After suctioning clear, tumor infiltration could be seen extending into the proximal aspect of the lower lobe and growing through the stent wall. The left upper lobe however appeared free of disease. At this point the flexible bronchoscope and LMA were removed and a 12mm ventilating rigid bronchoscope was subsequently inserted into the trachea and advanced into the left mainstem bronchus and was then connected to the JET ventilator. The rigid optic was removed and the Olympus T190 Therapeutic bronchoscope was inserted through the rigid lumen and advanced to the proximal edge to the stent. APC was used followed by gentile shaving of coagulated tissue with the tip of the bronchoscope to remove granulation tissue. We the utilized APC to burn the inner silicone coating from the stent and then gently placed flexible forceps through the wall of the stent to peel it from the mucosa. After this a size 4-5-6 Merit dilatational balloon was guided in a similar fashion outside of the stent and used to further break adhesions with the underlying airway wall. Open which we repeated multiple times attempting to slowly re-cannulate the airway. We then removed the flexible bronchoscope and utilized rigid forceps to grasp and remove the stent. APC was then used to cauterize the underlying inflamed mucosa and a 2.1 mm cryotherapy probe was used to remove debris. Significant obstruction both from endobronchial disease and extrinsic compressor however was still present. At this point we took our attention to the right sided airway and utilizing APC with the burn and shave technique attempting to re-cannulate the airway with partial success however obstruction remained > 50% in the right mainstem with tumor extending through the bronchus intermedius. Measurements of the airway were then taken in anticipation of airway stent placement. We customized a customized a 14x10x10 silicone Y-stent to a length of 30mm in the tracheal limb, 35mm in the right limb and 35 mm in the left mainstem limb. We also created a 10mm hole in the right sided limb to allow for the right upper lobe to remain ventilated while maintaining patency of the bronchus intermedius. The rigid bronchoscope was then advanced into the right mainstem and the stent was deployed. After deployment, the rigid forceps were used to manipulate the stent to adequately position the limbs within the proper airways resulting in successful stabilization of the airway. Persistent tumor beyond the stent remained bilaterally with small isolates of tumor in the distal bronchus intermedius and significant residual tumor in the left lower lobe bronchus. The rigid bronchoscope was removed and an LMA was inserted and the procedure was turned over to anesthesia for post-procedural care."
