  "SYN_2_8_3768": "We performed a rigid bronchoscopy to manage this patient's malignant airway obstruction and remove an embedded metallic stent. The right mainstem had significant tumor, and the left held the old stent which was overgrown with tissue and full of pus. We performed a lavage for culture. Using the rigid scope, APC, and balloons, we carefully dissected the metallic stent from the left mainstem and removed it. We also debulked the tumor on the right. Finally, we customized a silicone Y-stent and deployed it to stent open the trachea and both mainstems. The patient was stable at the end of the procedure."
