  "SYN_3_8_8048": "We attempted to open a complete blockage of the left mainstem bronchus caused by Wegener's granulomatosis. Using a rigid bronchoscope, we employed multiple techniques including electrosurgery, balloon dilation, and coring to tunnel through the scar tissue. Unfortunately, after advancing about 3cm, we encountered the pulmonary artery via a false lumen. We immediately stopped, applied fibrin glue to seal the defect, and intubated the patient. A post-procedure x-ray suggested a pneumothorax, so we placed a chest tube. The patient is currently stable in the ICU awaiting surgical opinion."
