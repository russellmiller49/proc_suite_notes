  "SYN_BRONCH_1_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nINDICATION: The patient presented with airway stent occlusion secondary to malignant central airway obstruction.\n\nPROCEDURE: Following the induction of general anesthesia, a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was introduced via a laryngeal mask airway. Inspection of the tracheobronchial tree revealed the indwelling silicone Y-stent to be structurally intact. However, substantial inspissated secretions were observed, causing varying degrees of obstruction within the tracheal and bronchial limbs. The right mainstem metallic stent was also noted to be impacted. A systematic debridement was undertaken utilizing mechanical disruption with the bronchoscope tip, extraction forceps, and mucolytic lavage with sodium bicarbonate. This resulted in the restoration of patency to the stented airways. Additionally, a targeted bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe for microbiological assessment. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate sequelae."
