  "SYN_BRONCH_1_5": "Procedure bronchoscopy pt has malignant airway obstruction and the stents are clogged up. used general anesthesia and LMA. looked down and saw the y stent and the metal one in the right side they were full of thick dry mucous. The RUL is kinda blocked by the stent but no pneumonia seen. LUL has a tumor but we left it alone. spent a long time cleaning out the mucous with forceps and bicarb and the scope tip. finally got it open. did a bal in the LUL anterior seg just to check. no bleeding really. sent to pacu."
