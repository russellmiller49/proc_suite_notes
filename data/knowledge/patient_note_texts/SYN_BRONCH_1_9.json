  "SYN_BRONCH_1_9": "PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction \nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Same\nINDICATIONS: Airway stent blockage \nSedation: General Anesthesia\nDESCRIPTION: The intervention was carried out in the bronchoscopy suite. After sedation, an LMA was placed and the therapeutic flexible bronchoscope was navigated through the vocal cords. The patient's Silicone Y-stent was seated correctly. There was substantial inspissated secretions with mild blockage of the tracheal limb, moderate blockage of the left bronchial limb and significant blockage of the right bronchial limb and the telescoping right mainstem covered metallic stent. The right upper lobe was partially blocked by the distal tip of the SEM but there was no sign of post-obstructive pneumonia. Through a combination of mechanical clearance with the bronchoscope tip, forceps extraction and use of sodium bicarbonate instillation the adhesive mucous was eliminated, with near complete reopening of the stents. Subsequently a mini lavage was conducted in the anterior segment of the left upper lobe. No bleeding was observed."
