  "SYN_BRONCH_2_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient was brought to the operative theater for diagnostic bronchoscopy regarding a right lower lobe pulmonary nodule. Following the induction of general anesthesia and intubation with an 8.5 mm endotracheal tube, the T190 video bronchoscope was utilized to survey the airway, which appeared anatomically normal. Electromagnetic navigation (SuperDimension) guided the extended working channel to the target lesion in the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Radial endobronchial ultrasound confirmed a concentric, heterogeneous signal. Transbronchial biopsies were obtained via needle and forceps; rapid on-site evaluation was consistent with malignancy. Subsequently, a linear endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope was deployed for mediastinal staging. Stations 4L, 7, and 4R were systematically sampled via transbronchial needle aspiration. Hemostasis at station 4R was achieved with topical iced saline."
