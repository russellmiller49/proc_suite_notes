  "SYN_BRONCH_2_5": "we did a nav bronch and ebus today for a lung nodule pt was asleep general anesthesia tube size 8.5 first we looked around everything looked normal then we used the superdimension thing to go to the RLL superior segment where the nodule was radial ultrasound showed it was concentric so we stuck it with the needle and the forceps ROSE said cancer. Then we switched to the big ultrasound scope and sampled nodes 4L 7 and 4R ROSE said lymphocytes ok. 4R bled a little bit so we put some ice water on it and it stopped no other issues thanks."
