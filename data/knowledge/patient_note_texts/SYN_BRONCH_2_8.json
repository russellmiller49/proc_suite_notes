  "SYN_BRONCH_2_8": "The patient underwent a navigational bronchoscopy and EBUS staging for a presumed lung cancer. After inducing general anesthesia and placing an 8.5 ETT, we inspected the airways and found no endobronchial lesions. We utilized the SuperDimension navigation system to reach the target in the RLL superior segment, confirming position with radial ultrasound. We took biopsies using both a needle and forceps; preliminary results suggest malignancy. We then switched to the EBUS scope and sampled lymph nodes at stations 4L, 7, and 4R. There was some minor bleeding at the 4R site which we stopped with iced saline. The patient was stable throughout."
