  "SYN_BRONCH_2_9": "Procedure Name: Guided Bronchoscopy and Staging EBUS\nIndications: Id[REDACTED] and staging of presumed lung cancer\nMedications: General Anesthesia\nFollowing intravenous medications and topical anesthesia, the video bronchoscope was inserted via an 8.5 ETT. The tracheobronchial tree was assessed. Anatomy was normal. The navigational guide was then inserted and registration was executed. Using the navigational map we advanced the catheter into the proximity of the lesion within the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Validation of placement with radial ultrasound showed a concentric view consistent with the nodule. Samples were then obtained with peripheral needle under fluoroscopic visualization with ROSE findings consistent with malignancy, additional forceps samples were then taken in the same location. \nThe flexible bronchoscope was then withdrawn and the convex probe EBUS bronchoscope was introduced. A systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node survey was carried out. Sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed beginning with the 4L Lymph node, followed by the 7 lymph node and finally the 4R lymph node. ROSE evaluation was consistent with adequate lymph node sampling in all stations. Active oozing was noted at the site of the 4R lymph node and topical iced saline was applied with subsequent resolution."
