  "SYN_BRONCH_3_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT\nINDICATION: Bilateral pulmonary opacities suspicious for malignancy.\nPROCEDURE: Following general anesthesia (8.5 ETT), flexible bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial fungating mass obstructing the right upper lobe (RUL) superior and anterior segments. This was sampled via transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and endobronchial forceps biopsy; hemostasis was achieved with epinephrine. Attention was turned to the left lower lobe (LLL), where a peripheral lesion in the superior segment was localized via radial EBUS (concentric view). This was sampled via TBNA and transbronchial forceps biopsy. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was also performed in the LLL superior segment for microbiologic analysis. Preliminary evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy in the RUL and necrosis in the LLL."
