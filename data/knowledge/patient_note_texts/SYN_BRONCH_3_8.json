  "SYN_BRONCH_3_8": "The patient presented with bilateral lung masses. Under general anesthesia, we performed a bronchoscopy. In the Right Upper Lobe, we found a fungating mass obstructing the airway. We took multiple biopsies using a needle and forceps; preliminary results suggest cancer. We controlled some bleeding with epinephrine. We then moved to the Left Lower Lobe, where we used radial ultrasound to find a peripheral lesion. We biopsied this as well, though the rapid check only showed dead tissue (necrosis). We also washed the area (BAL) to check for infection. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
