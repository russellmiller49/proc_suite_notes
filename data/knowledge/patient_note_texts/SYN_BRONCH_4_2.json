  "SYN_BRONCH_4_2": "OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nINDICATION: Right lower lobe mass.\n\nPROCEDURE: The patient was placed under general anesthesia. Diagnostic bronchoscopy revealed an endobronchial lesion within the superior segment of the right lower lobe (RLL). Multiple forceps biopsies were obtained. Hemostasis was secured using topical epinephrine and cold saline. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) suggested malignancy. Subsequently, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed for staging. Lymph node station 7 met sampling criteria (>5mm) and was aspirated four times. ROSE confirmed specimen adequacy. The patient tolerated the procedure without complication."
