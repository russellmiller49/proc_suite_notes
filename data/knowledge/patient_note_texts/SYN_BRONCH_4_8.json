  "SYN_BRONCH_4_8": "The patient presented with an RLL mass. We performed a bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Upon inspection, we found a lesion inside the airway of the right lower lobe's superior segment. We took several biopsies with forceps and used epinephrine and cold saline to stop the bleeding. The rapid test suggested it might be cancer. We then used the ultrasound scope (EBUS) to check the lymph nodes. Station 7 was enlarged, so we sampled it with a needle four times. The procedure went well with no complications."
