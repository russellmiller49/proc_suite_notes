  "SYN_BRONCH_4_9": "ANESTHESIA:  General\nINDICATIONS: Right lower lobe mass\nDESCRIPTION: Explanation of the procedure and all risks, benefits, and options were discussed. The risks include but were not limited to bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax. All questions were answered. \nThe patient was anesthetized with topical anesthesia and the bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth where topical lidocaine was instilled on the vocal cords and into the trachea. When adequate anesthesia was achieved, the bronchoscope was passed through the vocal cords and topical lidocaine administered on a local-regional fashion. The endobronchial tree was assessed and patient was found to have endobronchial lesion noted in the right lower lobe superior segment.  Multiple forceps samples were obtained at this time.  Lidocaine with epinephrine was instilled in addition to cold saline to achieve adequate hemostasis. ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample and possible evidence of malignancy.  The bronchoscope was then slowly withdrawn and removed.\nThe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope was inserted through the vocal cords.  Staging ultrasound performed.  Measured on ultrasound the 11 L, 10 L, for now, 7, 4R, 10 R, 11RS and 11Ri.  Station 7 was greater than 5 mm and therefore was sampled by needle aspiration x4.  ROSE at bedside confirmed adequate sample."
