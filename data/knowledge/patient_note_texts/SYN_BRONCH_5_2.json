  "SYN_BRONCH_5_2": "OPERATIVE SUMMARY: The patient, a 56-year-old male with cystic fibrosis, presented for evaluation of an RLL cavitary lesion. Under general anesthesia, a P190 hybrid bronchoscope was advanced. Inspection revealed purulent secretions emanating from the RLL superior segment. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Visualization of the segment revealed a cavity containing a fungal ball (mycetoma). Multiple forceps biopsies were obtained from this mass. The procedure was complicated by moderate hemorrhage, which was successfully arrested using 4cc epinephrine, 30cc iced saline, and segmental wedging. The patient was extubated and transferred to PACU."
