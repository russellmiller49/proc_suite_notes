  "SYN_BRONCH_5_8": "[REDACTED], a cystic fibrosis patient, underwent bronchoscopy for an RLL cavity. We used general anesthesia and a hybrid scope. We found pus coming from the RLL superior segment and performed a wash (BAL). Looking deeper, we found a cavity with a fungal ball inside. We took biopsies of this mass. It started bleeding moderately, so we used epinephrine, iced saline, and wedged the scope to stop it. He recovered well."
