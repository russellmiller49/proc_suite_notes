  "SYN_BRONCH_5_9": "INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  This is a 56 year old-year-old male with cystic fibrosis who presents with a cavitary lesion in right lower lobe.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  Patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery and informed consent was signed.\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:\nFollowing administration of intravenous medications and topical anesthesia to the upper airway, a P190 hybrid video bronchoscope was introduced through the endotracheal tube. The trachea appeared normal. The bronchoscope was advanced to the main carina, which was noted to have a sharp angle. The scope was then directed into the left mainstem bronchus, allowing visualization of all segments and subsegments of the left upper lobe, lingula, and lower lobe; no abnormalities were id[REDACTED] on the left side. The bronchoscope was withdrawn to the trachea and advanced into the right mainstem bronchus. All segments and subsegments of the right upper, middle, and lower lobes were examined. Purulent material was observed emanating from the superior segment of the right lower lobe. The bronchoscope was wedged in this segment, and a bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 60 cc of instilled saline, yielding 20 cc of return fluid. During the lavage, a cavity was visualized in the superior segment of the right lower lobe containing a well-demarcated soft tissue mass with a granular texture, consistent with a mycetoma. The right airway anatomy was notable for fusion of the apical and posterior segments in the right upper lobe; aside from the cavity, no additional masses or lesions were id[REDACTED]. After thorough inspection, multiple forceps samples were obtained from the mass within the cavity. Moderate bleeding ensued and was effectively managed with 4 cc of epinephrine, 30 cc of iced saline, and wedging of the scope in the affected segment, which successfully controlled the hemorrhage."
