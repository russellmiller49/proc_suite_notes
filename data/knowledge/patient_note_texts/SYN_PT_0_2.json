  "SYN_PT_0_2": "PROCEDURE: Diagnostic bronchoscopy with radial endobronchial ultrasound guidance.\nCLINICAL SUMMARY: The patient presented with a left lower lobe pulmonary nodule requiring tissue diagnosis.\nOPERATIVE REPORT: Under general anesthesia, the airways were inspected and found to be patent. A P190 ultrathin bronchoscope was navigated to the left lower lobe target. Utilization of a radial EBUS probe confirmed a concentric orientation to the lesion. Transbronchial biopsies and bronchial brushings were obtained. Preliminary rapid on-site evaluation was nondiagnostic. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
