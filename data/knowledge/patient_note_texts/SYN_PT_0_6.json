  "SYN_PT_0_6": "The patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and induced with general anesthesia. An LMA was placed. Initial inspection with a Q190 scope showed normal anatomy. We switched to a P190 ultrathin scope and navigated to the left lower lobe. The radial EBUS probe was inserted and a concentric image of the nodule was obtained. We performed transbronchial biopsies and brushings. There were no complications."
