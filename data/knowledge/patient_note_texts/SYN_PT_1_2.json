  "SYN_PT_1_2": "PROCEDURE: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS confirmation and multimodal sampling.\nNARRATIVE: Under general anesthesia with an 8.0 endotracheal tube, the tracheobronchial tree was inspected and found to be unremarkable. Utilizing pre-procedural mapping and the SuperDimension system, the 190-degree edge catheter was navigated to the right lower lobe nodule. Radial endobronchial ultrasound confirmed a concentric orientation. Diagnostic sampling was executed using a transbronchial needle, biopsy forceps, and a triple-needle brush. Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) confirmed malignancy. Hemostasis was secured."
