  "TBA-005": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. J. Alvarez\nAssistants: Pulmonary fellow; bronchoscopy nurse; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 25 mm solid right middle lobe lateral segment nodule in a patient with severe coronary artery disease and limited exercise tolerance.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local tumor control for presumed stage IA lung cancer using transbronchial ablation in a poor surgical candidate.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.5 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class IV.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (Illumisite) with cone-beam CT guidance.\n2. Double transbronchial microwave ablation of right middle lobe nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: After induction and intubation, the navigation bronchoscope was advanced along the pre-planned pathway to the lateral segment. Illumisite-based fluoroscopic navigation and tomosynthesis correction were used to align the extended working channel with the lesion. A CrossCountry needle was deployed and the tract dilated. The Emprint catheter was advanced and an initial 10-minute ablation was performed. Cone-beam CT showed adequate ablation but only a 3 mm minimal margin on the medial aspect. The catheter and extended working channel were repositioned slightly medial, and a second 8-minute ablation was delivered. Repeat cone-beam CT demonstrated a fused ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 6 mm circumferentially. Airways remained patent on inspection.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <10 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight for cardiac monitoring; discharge planned on post-procedure day 1 with follow-up CT at 3 months."
