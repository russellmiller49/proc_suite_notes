  "TBA-006": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. K. Osei\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 9 mm pure ground-glass nodule in the superior segment of the left lower lobe in a patient with advanced emphysema and prior contralateral segmentectomy.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Parenchyma-sparing local ablation of a high-risk ground-glass lesion in a patient not suitable for repeat resection.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: Following induction and intubation, the bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe. Navigation bronchoscopy guided the catheter to the superior segment airway. A cone-beam CT acquisition confirmed the position of the extended working channel tip relative to the subtle ground-glass lesion. The extended working channel was advanced slightly beyond the lesion center and the Emprint catheter deployed. Given the small lesion size, two shorter ablations (6 minutes and 5 minutes) at standard power were delivered without repositioning. Post-ablation cone-beam CT showed a spherical ablation zone centered on the lesion with an estimated minimal margin of 5 to 6 mm. No significant parenchymal hemorrhage or airway compromise was seen.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: None immediate. No pneumothorax.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and observed for 6 hours in the recovery unit; discharged the same day with follow-up CT planned at 6 months and ongoing surveillance as per lung cancer screening protocol."
