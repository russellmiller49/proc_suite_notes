  "TBA-007": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. M. Yamada\nAssistants: Pulmonary fellow; radiology technologist; circulating nurse.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 20 mm right upper lobe apical posterior segment nodule abutting the lung apex in a patient with chronic kidney disease and frailty.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local tumor control via transbronchial ablation to avoid the risks of percutaneous access to the lung apex.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Robotic-assisted navigation bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with cone-beam CT guidance in a hybrid operating room.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right upper lobe apical posterior segment nodule using Neuwave Flex microwave catheter.\n\nProcedure description: After induction, the Monarch robotic bronchoscope was navigated to the apical posterior subsegment using electromagnetic guidance and the virtual pathway. Stabilization of the outer sheath allowed precise advancement of the inner scope into the target bronchus. A peripheral lesion view was obtained on the navigation display, and cone-beam CT confirmed catheter alignment with the nodule. A flexible microwave catheter was advanced through the working channel into the lesion. Two overlapping ablations (8 minutes and 7 minutes) were delivered to ensure appropriate coverage given the lesion size. Post-ablation cone-beam CT demonstrated a well-centered ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 6 mm away from the chest wall and brachial plexus. Bronchoscopic inspection showed no significant bleeding.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight due to comorbidities; plan for follow-up CT in 3 months and multidisciplinary tumor board review."
