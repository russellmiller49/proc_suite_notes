  "TBA-008": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. R. Silva\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; radiology technologist; bronchoscopy nurse.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 18 mm left lower lobe basal segment nodule adjacent to the diaphragm in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local treatment of a presumed primary lung cancer while avoiding percutaneous access near the diaphragm and liver.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy using Illumisite platform.\n2. Mobile 3D C-arm (Cios Spin) cone-beam CT guidance.\n3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe basal segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: The navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the left lower lobe following CT-based registration. An initial Cios Spin acquisition confirmed nodule position and allowed updated navigation planning. The extended working channel tip was advanced to the basal segment bronchus and then into the parenchyma using a transbronchial needle. A second 3D acquisition verified that the catheter tip was 1 cm beyond the lesion center, accounting for the proximal ablation center of the Emprint catheter. Two sequential ablations (10 minutes and 5 minutes) were performed without catheter rotation. A final cone-beam CT demonstrated a circumferential ablation zone surrounding the lesion with a minimal margin of approximately 5 to 6 mm away from the diaphragm. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax was seen.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <10 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight for monitoring of hepatic function and volume status; follow-up CT arranged at 3 months."
