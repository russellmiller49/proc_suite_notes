  "TBA-009": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. C. Nguyen\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 15 mm left upper lobe lingular segment nodule in a patient status post right pneumonectomy for prior squamous cell carcinoma.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Lung-preserving local therapy for a new contralateral lesion in a single-lung patient.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 7.5 mm endotracheal tube; lung-protective ventilation; ASA class IV.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left upper lobe lingular nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: Following careful induction and low tidal-volume ventilation, the bronchoscope was advanced through the single-lumen endotracheal tube to the lingula. Navigation bronchoscopy and fluoroscopic tomosynthesis were used to align the extended working channel with the lesion. A transbronchial needle created a parenchymal tract, and the Emprint catheter was advanced. Because of the patient’s limited reserve, a single 8-minute ablation at standard power was chosen, minimizing procedure time while still targeting an adequate ablation zone. Cone-beam CT confirmed coverage of the 1.5 cm lesion with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm. No significant desaturation occurred during the case.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room to high-flow nasal cannula, monitored in a step-down unit overnight; plan for early follow-up CT at 6 weeks given prior pneumonectomy and limited functional reserve."
