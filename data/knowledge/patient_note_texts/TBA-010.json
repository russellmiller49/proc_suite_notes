  "TBA-010": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. E. Rossi\nAssistants: Pulmonary fellow; radiology technologist; bronchoscopy nurse.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 19 mm part-solid right lower lobe superior segment nodule with adjacent spread-through-airspaces on CT.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local ablation of early lung adenocarcinoma with extended parenchymal margin in a nonsurgical candidate.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT guidance.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n3. Adjunct bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation to the surrounding segment.\n\nProcedure description: Navigation bronchoscopy was used to reach the superior segment bronchus. A cone-beam CT acquisition confirmed catheter position. An Emprint catheter was positioned appropriately, and a 10-minute microwave ablation was delivered, yielding a well-centered ablation zone with an approximate 5 mm margin. To address suspected microscopic spread beyond the visible nodule, a dedicated vapor catheter was then positioned in the adjacent segmental airway, and thermal vapor energy was delivered to the surrounding lung parenchyma per manufacturer protocol. Post-treatment cone-beam CT demonstrated an extended area of ground-glass change enveloping the primary ablation zone and adjacent spread-through-airspaces. Airways remained patent on bronchoscopy.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: Transient post-procedural fever expected from vapor ablation; no pneumothorax.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted for overnight observation with antipyretic therapy; follow-up CT planned at 3 and 12 months."
