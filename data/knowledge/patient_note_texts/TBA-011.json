  "TBA-011": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. H. Malik\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 17 mm solid right lower lobe medial basal segment nodule in a patient with oligometastatic colorectal cancer.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local control of a solitary pulmonary metastasis in the setting of controlled systemic disease.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.5 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT.\n2. Transbronchial radiofrequency ablation of right lower lobe nodule using cooled RFA catheter.\n\nProcedure description: After induction and intubation, the navigation bronchoscope was guided to the medial basal segment. A pre-procedural cone-beam CT set was used for planning. A bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA catheter was positioned in the center of the lesion via an extended working channel, with position confirmed by fluoroscopy and repeat cone-beam CT. Radiofrequency energy was delivered in a single 12-minute application using a cooled system to limit airway injury. Post-ablation cone-beam CT revealed a sharply marginated ablation zone surrounding the lesion with an estimated minimal margin of approximately 5 mm, without pleural disruption. Bronchoscopy showed mild mucosal erythema but no charring.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: None immediate; no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and discharged home after 6 hours of observation, with oncology follow-up and CT at 3 months."
