  "TBA-012": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. P. Hart\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; bronchoscopy nurse; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 22 mm left upper lobe posterior segment nodule in close proximity to segmental vessels.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local tumor control via transbronchial radiofrequency ablation in a high-risk surgical patient.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS confirmation.\n2. Transbronchial cooled radiofrequency ablation of left upper lobe nodule.\n\nProcedure description: The navigation bronchoscope was used to reach the posterior segment bronchus, and radial EBUS confirmed an eccentric lesion adjacent to a vessel. A cooled RFA catheter was positioned within the nodule under fluoroscopic guidance. Energy was applied in two overlapping 8-minute cycles with catheter rotation between cycles to avoid hot spots near the vessel. Interval cone-beam CT showed a uniform ablation zone encasing the lesion with preservation of nearby major vessels. Final imaging demonstrated an approximate 6 mm minimal margin around the nodule. Endoscopic inspection showed no significant bleeding or airway compromise.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <10 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight for observation; scheduled follow-up CT and multidisciplinary discussion at tumor board."
