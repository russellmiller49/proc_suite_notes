  "TBA-013": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. V. Romero\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; anesthesia team; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 14 mm right lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule in a patient undergoing an early feasibility trial of pulsed electric field (PEF) ablation.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Focal nonthermal ablation of an early-stage lung cancer as part of a clinical trial in a nonsurgical candidate.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation.\n2. Transbronchial pulsed electric field ablation of right lower lobe nodule using investigational PEF catheter.\n\nProcedure description: After standard induction, the navigation bronchoscope was advanced to the target segment. The investigational PEF catheter was introduced via an extended working channel after CT-to-body divergence correction. Cone-beam CT confirmed the catheter centered within the lesion. A series of biphasic pulsed electric field deliveries were performed per trial protocol, with multiple short pulses at pre-specified amplitudes and frequencies. No temperature rise was detected on the catheter thermistor. Post-treatment cone-beam CT showed a sharply demarcated ablation zone around the lesion without pleural disruption. Airways proximal to the treatment site appeared intact.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <5 mL.\nComplications: None immediate; no arrhythmia or hemodynamic instability during pulse delivery.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and monitored overnight on telemetry per protocol; follow-up imaging and trial visits scheduled."
