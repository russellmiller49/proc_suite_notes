  "TBA-014": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. G. Ahmed\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; bronchoscopy nurse; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: Two synchronous lung nodules: 14 mm right upper lobe posterior segment and 11 mm right lower lobe superior segment, both PET-avid, in a patient with COPD and limited pulmonary reserve.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Staged local ablation of multifocal early lung cancers in a nonsurgical candidate.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.5 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT guidance.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right upper lobe posterior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of right lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: After induction, navigation bronchoscopy targeted the right upper lobe lesion first. A CrossCountry needle and extended working channel were positioned into the lesion and a single 8-minute ablation was delivered. Cone-beam CT confirmed an adequate ablation zone with an estimated 5 mm margin. The catheter and bronchoscope were then redirected to the right lower lobe superior segment. Following similar navigation and tract creation, a 6-minute ablation was delivered to the smaller lesion. A combined cone-beam CT demonstrated discrete ablation zones covering both nodules without overlap and without pleural disruption.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <10 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and admitted overnight given bilateral parenchymal treatment in a single session; follow-up CT arranged at 3 months to assess both ablation sites."
