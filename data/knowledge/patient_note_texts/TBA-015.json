  "TBA-015": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending physician: Dr. D. Shah\nAssistants: Interventional pulmonology fellow; bronchoscopy nurse; radiology technologist.\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 21 mm left lower lobe superior segment nodule in a patient with severe COPD and prior lung volume reduction surgery.\nPost-procedure diagnosis: Same.\nIndication: Local ablation of presumed primary lung cancer while preserving remaining lung parenchyma.\nAnesthesia: General anesthesia with 8.0 mm endotracheal tube; ASA class III.\n\nProcedures performed:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT guidance.\n2. Transbronchial microwave ablation of left lower lobe superior segment nodule using Emprint catheter.\n\nProcedure description: Following induction and intubation, navigation bronchoscopy was used to reach the superior segment bronchus. After CT-to-body divergence correction with tomosynthesis, a transbronchial needle was advanced into the lesion and the extended working channel positioned. A 10-minute microwave ablation was delivered. Cone-beam CT revealed an ablation zone encompassing the lesion but with a narrow posterolateral margin of approximately 3 mm. Given emphysematous parenchyma and prior surgery, a second shorter (5-minute) ablation was delivered with slight catheter repositioning posterolaterally. Final imaging demonstrated a more symmetric ablation zone with a minimal margin of approximately 6 mm. Airways appeared patent on bronchoscopy.\n\nEstimated blood loss: <10 mL.\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Extubated in the operating room and observed for 23 hours due to underlying lung disease; follow-up CT and pulmonary function testing planned at 3 months."
