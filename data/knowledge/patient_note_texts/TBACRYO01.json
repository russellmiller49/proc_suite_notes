  "TBACRYO01": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending: Dr. R. Silva\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 15 mm right lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule, high-risk for malignancy.\nIndication: Local treatment of peripheral lung cancer with investigational transbronchial cryoablation.\n\nProcedures:\n1. ENB-guided bronchoscopy (superDimension) with CBCT.\n2. Radial EBUS localization of peripheral lesion.\n3. Transbronchial cryoablation using a flexible cryoprobe with dual-freeze protocol.\n\nDescription: Following general anesthesia and ENB navigation, CBCT confirmed the extended working channel traversing the lesion. A novel flexible cryoprobe was advanced to the lesion center. Three freeze–thaw cycles were performed (8–5–8 minutes, with passive thaw between freezes). CBCT after the final cycle showed a homogeneous low-attenuation zone with a rim of ground-glass change surrounding the lesion and an estimated minimal margin of approximately 6 mm. Airways remained patent.\n\nComplications: None immediate.\nDisposition: Overnight admission for monitoring; CT chest at 3 months."
