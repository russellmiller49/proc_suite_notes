Navigation and radial EBUS confirmed the lesion position. Transbronchial biopsies yielded adenocarcinoma on frozen section. Immediate microwave ablation was then performed via the same access tract. Post-ablation CBCT confirmed a centered ablation zone with a 5 mm margin.",

  "TBAMWA04_syn_6": "A 69-year-old female underwent same-session biopsy and microwave ablation of a 16 mm left lower lobe nodule. Electromagnetic navigation and radial EBUS were used. Frozen section confirmed adenocarcinoma. A single 10-minute ablation was delivered. Post-ablation imaging showed a 5 mm margin, partially obscured by perilesional hemorrhage. Mild bleeding was self-limited.",

We first navigated to the lesion and took biopsies, which confirmed cancer while the patient was asleep. We then immediately proceeded to treat the tumor with microwave ablation. The procedure went well with only minor bleeding.",

  "TBAMWA04": "Interventional Pulmonology Procedure Note\nPatient ID: [REDACTED]\nDate of procedure: [REDACTED]\nAttending: Dr. S. Moreno\n\nPre-procedure diagnosis: 16 mm peripheral left lower lobe lateral basal segment nodule with high probability of malignancy.\nIndication: Same-session diagnosis and local control via transbronchial biopsy and microwave ablation.\n\nProcedures:\n1. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with radial EBUS.\n2. Transbronchial forceps biopsies for frozen section.\n3. Transbronchial microwave ablation of LLL nodule.\n\nDescription: Navigation and radial EBUS confirmed a concentric lesion. Two forceps biopsies were obtained via the EWC and submitted for frozen section, which showed invasive adenocarcinoma. An Emprint catheter was then advanced and a 10-minute ablation was delivered. CBCT showed a well-centered ablation zone with an estimated minimal margin of 5 mm, although interpretation was partially limited by perilesional hemorrhage.\n\nComplications: Mild self-limited bleeding at biopsy site; no pneumothorax.\nDisposition: Overnight observation; planned CT in 3 months; oncology referral."
