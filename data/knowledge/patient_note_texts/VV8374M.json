Molecular sent.\nPlan: Oncology referral.",
  "VV8374M_syn_2": "PROCEDURE SUMMARY: The patient underwent EBUS-TBNA and endobronchial biopsy for staging of an RUL mass. EBUS evaluation of station 4R (12mm) and station 7 (15mm) yielded malignant cells (Adenocarcinoma) on ROSE. Station 10R was benign. The primary endobronchial mass was biopsied, yielding adequate diagnostic tissue. Findings are consistent with N2 disease. Molecular profiling has been initiated.",

  "VV8374M_syn_8": "I called Dr. Adams to give a quick update on [REDACTED]. We did the EBUS and biopsy today. It looks like N2 disease; stations 4R and 7 were positive for adenocarcinoma on the rapid onsite check. Station 10R was negative. We also grabbed about 6 biopsies of the main mass in the right upper lobe. We've sent the samples for molecular testing.",

Adequate tissue obtained.\n\nSTAGING:\nAppears to be N2 disease (multi-station involvement at levels 4R and 7).\nMolecular testing sent from station 4R sample - should have results in 7-10 days.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nNone. Patient tolerated well and discharged home stable.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\n1. Final pathology in 3-5 days\n2. Molecular results in 7-10 days\n3. Recommend tumor board discussion\n4. Patient follow-up in your clinic next week per discussion\n\nWill send formal typed report tomorrow. Feel free to call with questions."
