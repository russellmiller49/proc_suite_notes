  "1248551": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION\n\nPatient [REDACTED]: Amanda Kim\nMedical Record [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\nDate of Birth: [REDACTED] (Age: 67 years)\nBiological Sex: Female\nDate of Procedure: [REDACTED]\nInstitution: [REDACTED]\n\nCLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION\n\nThis 67-year-old female patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed peripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 21.6 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the RUL anterior (B3), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. \n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 10L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 13.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 4L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 22-gauge Standard FNA needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 1.8 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the RUL anterior (B3).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via cbct.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (8 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (4 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed granuloma.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of RUL pulmonary lesion\n3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of malignant - nsclc nos\n4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed\n\nTotal Procedure Duration: 85 minutes\n\nElectronically Signed,\nRobert Patel, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nPresbyterian Hospital"
