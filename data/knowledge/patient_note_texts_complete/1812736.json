After confirmation of lung re-expansion and lidocaine premedication, a slurry containing 4 grams of sterile talc was instilled. The patient was rotated through standard positions to ensure distribution. The tube was unclamped after 60 minutes.",

  "1812736": "Name: [REDACTED]\nAge/Sex: 68/Female\nMRN: [REDACTED]\nDate: [REDACTED]\nLocation: [REDACTED]\nAttending Physician: Dr. Thomas Anderson\nIndication: Recurrent malignant pleural effusion (metastatic ovarian cancer), right-sided, despite optimal drainage via chest tube\nBackground: Patient has had 28Fr chest tube in place for 5 days. Initial drainage was 1400mL, then decreased to <100mL/day for the past 48 hours. CXR today shows good lung expansion with only minimal residual pleural fluid. No air leak present. Patient is appropriate candidate for pleurodesis.\nConsent: Obtained from patient. Risks discussed include chest pain/discomfort, fever, respiratory distress (rare), failure of pleurodesis requiring repeat procedure.\nPremedication:\n\nMorphine 4mg IV given 30 minutes prior\nAcetaminophen 1000mg PO given 1 hour prior\nOndansetron 4mg IV given for nausea prophylaxis\n\n\nPROCEDURE STEPS:\nStep 1 - Verification (Time: 14:00)\n\nVerified chest tube patency by flushing with 10mL sterile saline\nConfirmed no air leak on water seal\nReviewed most recent CXR with radiologist - confirmed adequate lung expansion\n\nStep 2 - Lidocaine Administration (Time: 14:05)\n\nDrew up 20mL of 1% lidocaine (200mg total)\nAdministered through chest tube slowly over 2 minutes\nClamped tube for 5 minutes to allow lidocaine to distribute\nReleased clamp, allowed to drain\n\nStep 3 - Talc Slurry Preparation (Time: 14:15)\n\nPrepared sterile talc slurry: 4 grams talc powder in 50mL normal saline\nMixed thoroughly in sterile cup until uniform suspension achieved\nDrew up into 60mL catheter tip syringe\n\nStep 4 - Talc Administration (Time: 14:20)\n\nSlowly instilled talc slurry through chest tube over 5 minutes\nFollowed with 20mL normal saline flush to ensure complete delivery\nImmediately clamped chest tube\n\nStep 5 - Position Changes (Time: 14:25 - 15:25)\nPatient [REDACTED] positions every 15 minutes to distribute talc:\n\nPosition 1 (14:25): Supine - 15 minutes\nPosition 2 (14:40): Right lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 3 (14:55): Prone (as tolerated) - 10 minutes\nPosition 4 (15:05): Left lateral decubitus - 15 minutes\nPosition 5 (15:20): Return to supine - 5 minutes\n\nTotal dwell time: 60 minutes\nStep 6 - Resumption of Drainage (Time: 15:25)\n\nReleased clamp on chest tube\nConnected back to suction at -20 cmH2O\nImmediate return of approximately 30mL serosanguineous fluid\n\n\nPATIENT [REDACTED]:\nDuring procedure:\n\nVital signs stable throughout\nComplained of moderate chest discomfort (5/10) during position changes\nReceived additional morphine 2mg IV at 14:50\nNo respiratory distress\nOxygen saturation maintained >94% on 2L NC\n\nPost-procedure (2 hours observation):\n\nChest discomfort decreased to 3/10\nNo fever (temp 37.2°C)\nNo dyspnea\nChest tube draining serosanguineous fluid, approximately 50mL total since unclamping\n\nSPECIMENS: None\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nPOST-PROCEDURE ORDERS:\n\nContinue chest tube to suction -20 cmH2O\nMonitor drainage every 4 hours\nPain control: Morphine 2-4mg IV q4h PRN, acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h scheduled\nChest X-ray in AM\nIf drainage <150mL over next 24 hours AND CXR shows no reaccumulation, consider chest tube removal in 48-72 hours\n\nASSESSMENT: Chemical pleurodesis with talc slurry via chest tube completed successfully without complications. Patient tolerated procedure reasonably well with adequate pain control. Will monitor for pleurodesis efficacy over next several days.\nFollow-up Plan:\n\nDaily CXR while chest tube in place\nRemove chest tube when drainage criteria met (typically 2-3 days)\nFollow-up CXR 1 week after chest tube removal\nIf recurrent effusion develops, may consider PleurX catheter placement"
