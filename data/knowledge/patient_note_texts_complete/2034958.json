Balloon dilation. 14x60mm metallic stent placed. PleurX catheter placed right hemithorax.\nComplication: None.\nResult: Airway patent. Effusion drained.",
  "2034958_syn_2": "OPERATIVE NARRATIVE: The patient was brought to the operating suite for management of complex malignant central airway obstruction and malignant pleural effusion. Under general anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopic intubation, the right mainstem bronchus was visualized, demonstrating 90% occlusion by fungating tumor. Mechanical debulking was performed utilizing the rigid barrel, followed by electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation to the tumor base (CPT 31641). Following balloon dilation, a covered metallic stent was deployed, restoring luminal patency to the right mainstem bronchus (CPT 31636). Subsequently, a tunneled indwelling pleural catheter was inserted into the right hemithorax for palliation of the recurrent effusion (CPT 32550).",

Justification: APC and mechanical coring used to relieve right mainstem obstruction.\n2. 31636: Bronchoscopy with stent placement. Justification: Covered metallic stent deployed in R mainstem after debulking.\n3. 32550: Insertion of tunneled pleural catheter.

  "2034958_syn_5": "we did a rigid bronch today on Clara Oswin for that airway tumor right side. used the storz scope cored out the tumor and burned the rest with APC. put a stent in there looks wide open now. also put in a pleurx catheter for the fluid on the right side. no issues really patient stable to recovery.",
  "2034958_syn_6": "The patient presented with right lung collapse and effusion. General anesthesia. Rigid bronchoscopy performed. Right mainstem tumor debrided mechanically and with APC.

  "2034958_syn_8": "[REDACTED] taken to the OR for airway management. We utilized a rigid bronchoscope to access the airway. A large tumor in the right mainstem was effectively removed using mechanical coring and heat therapy. To prevent re-obstruction, we deployed a metallic stent. While she was under, we also addressed her fluid buildup by placing a tunneled PleurX catheter in the right chest. She tolerated all distinct procedures well.",
  "2034958_syn_9": "Procedure: Rigid bronchoscopy with tumor ablation and stent deployment; indwelling pleural catheter insertion.\nAction: The right mainstem neoplasm was resected using the rigid barrel and argon plasma coagulation. Patency was re-established. An airway prosthesis was anchored in the right mainstem. A tunneled pleural drainage system was implanted in the right hemithorax.\nOutcome: Successful recanalization and fluid drainage.",
