Rigid bronchoscopy\n2. Removal of prior SEMS\n3. Silicone Y-stent (Dumon) placement\n\nANESTHESIA: General, jet ventilation\n\nPROCEDURE: Under GA with rigid bronchoscopy (14mm Dumon), the previously placed covered SEMS was removed using rigid forceps with en bloc extraction. Tracheomalacia confirmed with >75% collapse on expiration involving distal trachea and proximal mainstems bilaterally.\n\nA Novatech silicone Y-stent (18mm trachea, 14mm bilateral limbs, 50mm body length) was loaded on the deployment rod. Under direct visualization, the Y-stent was advanced and deployed with the carinal spur appropriately positioned. Both mainstem limbs expanded well. Post-deployment bronchoscopy confirmed patent airways bilaterally, good stent positioning, no mucus impaction.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None\nEBL: 10mL\nDISPOSITION: PACU, discharge same day\n\nDr. James Walker, MD"
