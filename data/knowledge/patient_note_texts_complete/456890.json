Initial thoracentesis 2 days ago showed complicated parapneumonic effusion. Persistent effusion with fever, decision made for catheter drainage.\n\nProcedure:\nPatient [REDACTED] at bedside. Right posterolateral chest, 7th ICS posterior axillary line. Standard sterile prep. Local anesthesia with lidocaine.\n\nWithout imaging guidance, 14Fr pigtail catheter placed using Seldinger technique. Immediate return of turbid yellow-green fluid. 900mL drained during procedure. Catheter sutured and connected to underwater seal drainage.\n\nFluid analysis: pH 7.15, glucose 35, LDH 1250 - consistent with complicated parapneumonic/early empyema.\n\nNo pneumothorax on bedside ultrasound. Patient comfortable.\n\nPlan: Continuous drainage. If inadequate, will consider fibrinolytics vs thoracoscopy.\n\nP. Lee MD"
