Referred for combined mediastinal staging and bronchoscopic diagnosis of the parenchymal lesion.\n\nANESTHESIA/AIRWAY:\nGeneral anesthesia with ETT.

The pre-procedure CT was registered and the right lower lobe lesion target planned. Navigation error was approximately 2.5 mm.\n\nA thin bronchoscope was advanced along the projected path to a subsegmental bronchus in the basilar segment of the RLL. The target lesion was reached and confirmed by fluoroscopy. Multiple transbronchial biopsies (5 forceps samples) and cytology brushings (2) were obtained from the lesion.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nMinor bleeding controlled with cold saline and suction. No significant hypoxia or pneumothorax observed. Estimated blood loss < 10 mL.\n\nDISPOSITION:\nThe patient was extubated and transferred to PACU in stable condition, with a post-procedure CXR ordered. She will follow up in IP clinic in 1–2 weeks.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nCombined EBUS-TBNA of 4R, 7, and 11R nodes and navigational bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic confirmation and transbronchial biopsies of an RLL mass."
