Systematic treatment of the right lower lobe was undertaken. Radiofrequency energy was delivered to the distal airways of all basal segments and the superior segment, totaling 59 activations. The bronchial mucosa appeared blanched consistent with effective treatment. The patient tolerated the procedure well without bronchospasm.",
