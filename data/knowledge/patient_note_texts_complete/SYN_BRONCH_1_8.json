  "SYN_BRONCH_1_8": "The patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite for management of airway stent occlusion. Under general anesthesia, we inserted an LMA and advanced the therapeutic bronchoscope. The silicone Y-stent was in good position, but the limbs were heavily obstructed by thick, dry mucus, particularly on the right side involving the metallic stent. We proceeded to clear these obstructions using a combination of mechanical disruption, forceps removal, and sodium bicarbonate instillation. This successfully recanalized the stents. We also noted a tumor at the LUL takeoff but decided against intervention at this time. Finally, we performed a mini-BAL in the left upper lobe anterior segment before concluding the procedure."
