Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 07:00\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 09:02\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 122 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Fujifilm EB-580S\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4021 (21G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 7: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 8.3mm (short axis) x 24.2mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Atypical cells.\nStation 11R: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 19.4mm (short axis) x 15.1mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\nStation 11L: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.1mm (short axis) x 15.1mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 21G needle. ROSE: Granuloma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LUL superior lingula (B4)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 34.7 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 9.5 mm\n- CT appearance: Part-solid\n- Bronchus sign: Positive\n- PET SUV max: 12.7\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Radial EBUS\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 5 specimens\n- TBNA: 3 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Suspicious for malignancy\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 7, 11R, 11L - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nSteven Park\nInterventional Pulmonology\nUniversity Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n"
