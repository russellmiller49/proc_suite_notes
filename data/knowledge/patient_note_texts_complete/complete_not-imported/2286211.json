  "2286211": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Steven Park, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nCombined staging and peripheral nodule diagnosis. Target lesion: 27.5mm ground-glass nodule localized to RLL superior (B6).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 22-gauge aspiration needle (Acquire).\n\nStation 11R: Visualized homogeneous node (22.0x13.6mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\nStation 4R: Visualized heterogeneous node (13.7x29.3mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Atypical cells.\nStation 11L: Visualized homogeneous node (18.9x31.0mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Galaxy robotic navigation platform (Noah Medical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 2.8mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the RLL superior (B6) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding eccentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via cbct.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 4\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 3  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from RLL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (3 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\n[REDACTED], MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nBaptist Medical Center"
