  "2777264": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED]\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Lisa Thompson, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nLung nodule evaluation with mediastinal lymphadenopathy workup. Target lesion: 23.3mm solid nodule localized to RLL posterior basal (B10).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 21-gauge aspiration needle (Standard FNA).\n\nStation 10R: Visualized homogeneous node (11.9x22.1mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma.\nStation 4R: Visualized homogeneous node (21.4x27.6mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 7: Visualized heterogeneous node (16.1x28.6mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Granuloma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Galaxy robotic navigation platform (Noah Medical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 2.4mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the RLL posterior basal (B10) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding concentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via cbct.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 6\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 3  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from RLL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (3 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nLisa Thompson, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nCommunity Hospital"
