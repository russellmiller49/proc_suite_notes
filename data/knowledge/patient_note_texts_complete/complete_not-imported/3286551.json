Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Monarch platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 08:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 09:32\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 77 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Cook EchoTip ProCore (22G FNB/ProCore)\n- Robotic platform: Monarch (Auris Health (J&J))\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 4L: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 18.3mm (short axis) x 28.3mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 10R: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 14.8mm (short axis) x 23.9mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 4R: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 20.9mm (short axis) x 20.6mm (long axis). 4 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\nStation 7: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 24.0mm (short axis) x 28.4mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: RUL anterior (B3)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 30.9 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 17.5 mm\n- CT appearance: Ground-glass\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 6 specimens\n- TBNA: 4 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Granuloma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 4L, 10R, 4R, 7 - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from RUL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from RUL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from RUL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 4 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nSteven Park\nInterventional Pulmonology\nRegional Medical Center\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n"
