  "3293967": "Jack Brooks, MRN [REDACTED], a 54-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at Regional Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was peripheral lung nodule with suspicious mediastinal nodes with a 19.4mm solid lesion in the RUL anterior (B3), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 6.7. The patient was ASA class 2 with smoking history of 54 pack-years (former). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (21.2mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 2L (8.8mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Atypical cells); station 11L (13.8mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Monarch robotic bronchoscopy system (Auris Health (J&J)) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 1.5mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RUL anterior (B3) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed concentric view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by augmented fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed granuloma.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 131 minutes. Attending physician: Eric Johnson, MD."
