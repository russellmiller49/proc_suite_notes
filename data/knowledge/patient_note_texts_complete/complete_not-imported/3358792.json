Thoracentesis for diagnostic workup and staging.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Informed consent obtained, risks/benefits discussed including pneumothorax, bleeding, infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema\n- Timeout performed with entire team\n- Bedside ultrasound: Left pleural effusion, maximum depth 5.2 cm, small amount of septations noted\n- Vital signs: BP 138/84, HR 82, SpO2 96% on RA\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned sitting, leaning forward on bedside table\n- Left posterior chest, 9th intercostal space, posterior axillary line\n- Skin prepped with chlorhexidine, sterile drape applied\n- Local anesthesia: 12 mL 1% lidocaine administered\n- Ultrasound-guided insertion of 18-gauge catheter-over-needle system\n- Septations noted on ultrasound but fluid pocket adequate for safe drainage\n- Initial fluid: bloody appearance\n- Total volume removed: 650 mL\n- Drainage ceased as fluid became more viscous\n- Post-procedure ultrasound: residual fluid present, no pneumothorax\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid analysis (cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, pH)\n- Pleural fluid cytology (2 specimens)\n- Pleural fluid cultures (aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal)\n- Pleural fluid flow cytometry\n- Pleural fluid tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9)\n\n**IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**\n- Appearance: Bloody (frank blood)\n- Likely exudative effusion based on clinical context\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure tolerated adequately\n- Patient developed transient chest pain (5/10) which resolved with position change\n- Chest X-ray ordered (PA and lateral when patient able)\n- Vital signs: BP 142/88, HR 84, SpO2 96% on RA\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Diagnostic thoracentesis of left hemorrhagic pleural effusion in patient with lung mass. Hemorrhagic effusion concerning for malignant pleural disease. Septations noted which may require further intervention if fluid reaccumulates.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Await cytology results\n- Review CT chest\n- Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion\n- May require pleuroscopy for diagnosis and pleurodesis if cytology non-diagnostic\n- Consider oncology consultation"
