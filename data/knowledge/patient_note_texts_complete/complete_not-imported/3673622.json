  "3673622": "Brandon Morris, MRN [REDACTED], a 47-year-old female underwent combined endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging and robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral lung biopsy at St. Luke's Medical Center on [REDACTED]. The indication was lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a 19.5mm solid lesion in the RLL posterior basal (B10), bronchus sign positive, PET SUV max 5.4. The patient was ASA class 3 with smoking history of None pack-years (never). General anesthesia was induced and the patient was intubated with a 8.0mm endotracheal tube.\n\nLinear EBUS was performed using the Fujifilm EB-580S bronchoscope with 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. The following mediastinal and hilar lymph node stations were systematically sampled: station 10R (11.4mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - adenocarcinoma); station 7 (8.1mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy); station 2R (13.6mm, 2 passes, ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes); station 4R (22.2mm, 3 passes, ROSE: Malignant - small cell carcinoma). Rapid on-site evaluation was available for all stations.\n\nThe Ion robotic bronchoscopy system (Intuitive Surgical) was then utilized for navigation to the peripheral target. CT-to-body registration was performed with registration error of 3.2mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the RLL posterior basal (B10) and radial EBUS probe deployment revealed adjacent view of the lesion. Tool-in-lesion was confirmed by fluoroscopy. Transbronchial forceps biopsies (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and brushings (2) were obtained. Bronchoalveolar lavage was collected for microbiological studies. ROSE evaluation of the peripheral specimens showed malignant - nsclc nos.\n\nThe procedure was completed without complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 10mL. Post-procedure chest radiograph showed no pneumothorax. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with follow-up scheduled for pathology review. Specimens were sent for cytology, cell block, surgical pathology, and cultures.\n\nProcedure time: 91 minutes. Attending physician: Eric Johnson, MD."
