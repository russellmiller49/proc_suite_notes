  "3792313": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nPatient: [REDACTED] Baker\nMedical Record: [REDACTED]\nService Date: [REDACTED]\nOperator: Robert Patel, MD\n\nCLINICAL RATIONALE\nPeripheral nodule and bilateral hilar adenopathy. Target lesion: 21.6mm ground-glass nodule localized to RUL anterior (B3).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Fujifilm EB-580S) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 22-gauge aspiration needle (Standard FNA).\n\nStation 10L: Visualized heterogeneous node (13.0x14.3mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\nStation 4L: Visualized homogeneous node (15.7x23.7mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 11L: Visualized heterogeneous node (19.4x27.5mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Ion robotic navigation platform (Intuitive Surgical) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 1.8mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the RUL anterior (B3) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding eccentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via cbct.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 8\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 4  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from RUL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Granuloma\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (3 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nRobert Patel, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nPresbyterian Hospital"
