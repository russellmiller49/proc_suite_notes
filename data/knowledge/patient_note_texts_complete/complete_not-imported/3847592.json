Concern for lung metastasis vs new primary. Please evaluate and biopsy if appropriate. Also noted to have enlarged subcarinal node.\"\n\n**HISTORY:**\n74F with PMH of Stage II ER+/HER2- invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed 2017, treated with lumpectomy + radiation + endocrine therapy. Developed bone and liver metastases 2023, currently on palbociclib + letrozole with stable disease.\n\nRecent surveillance CT shows new 2.8cm RLL nodule (not present on prior CT 6 months ago). Also new subcarinal lymphadenopathy 2.1cm. PET/CT: RLL nodule SUV 6.4, subcarinal node SUV 5.9.\n\nClinical question: Progression of breast cancer to lung vs. new primary lung cancer (would change management significantly).\n\n**RECOMMENDATION:**\nCombined EBUS-TBNA + EMN bronchoscopy for tissue diagnosis with appropriate immunohistochemistry to differentiate breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.\n\nPatient [REDACTED]or procedure same day given oncologic urgency.\n**PROCEDURE PERFORMED:**\n\n**EBUS-TBNA + EMN Bronchoscopy + Transbronchial Biopsy**\n\nConsent obtained.

Adenocarcinoma cells. CK7+/CK20- pattern on rapid IHC. Cannot definitively distinguish breast met vs lung primary on cytology alone - recommend tissue biopsy with full IHC panel.\"\n\nOther stations surveyed - no other enlarged nodes.\n\n**PHASE 2 - EMN to RLL nodule:**\n\nSuperDimension system. CT from [REDACTED] loaded.\nTarget: RLL lateral basal segment nodule.\n\nRegistration: Auto, 8 points, good accuracy.\n\nNavigated to target - distance 0.7cm per system.\n\nRadial EBUS: Concentric pattern, 26mm heterogeneous lesion.\n\nSampling:\n- TBBx x 8 (formalin - **REQUEST FULL IHC PANEL: TTF-1, Napsin-A, CK7, CK20, ER, PR, HER2, GATA-3, Mammaglobin**)\n- Brushings x 3\n- BAL\n\nROSE: \"Adenocarcinoma. Morphology could represent either primary lung or breast metastasis. IHC panel will be definitive.\"\n\nNo complications. CXR: no PTX.\n\n**IMPRESSION:**\nAdenocarcinoma in both subcarinal node and RLL nodule. Awaiting IHC to determine if breast metastasis vs primary lung cancer.\n\nIf breast metastasis → continue systemic breast cancer therapy\nIf primary lung cancer → separate staging/treatment approach needed\n\n**PLAN:**\n- IHC panel expedited (results expected 05/09)\n- Contact patient with results\n- Tumor board if lung primary confirmed\n- Close communication with medical oncology\n\nK.
