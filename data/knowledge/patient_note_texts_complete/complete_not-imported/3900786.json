Target lesion: 30.2mm ground-glass nodule localized to LUL inferior lingula (B5).\n\nSEDATION DETAILS\nGeneral endotracheal sedation administered. 8.0mm airway device deployed orally.\n\nOPERATIVE NARRATIVE\n\nSEGMENT 1: LINEAR EBUS MEDIASTINAL ASSESSMENT\n\nThe convex-probe ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC190F) was advanced through the endotracheal conduit. Systematic mediastinal survey was executed. Lymph nodes were visualized at multiple stations and sampled utilizing 22-gauge aspiration needle (Acquire).\n\nStation 4R: Visualized heterogeneous node (22.1x22.1mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Atypical cells.\nStation 2R: Visualized heterogeneous node (14.8x16.0mm). Executed 4 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 2L: Visualized homogeneous node (15.4x34.5mm). Executed 2 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Granuloma.\nStation 10L: Visualized homogeneous node (10.7x16.3mm). Executed 3 aspiration passes. ROSE yielded: Malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nSEGMENT 2: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED PERIPHERAL NAVIGATION\n\nThe Monarch robotic navigation platform (Auris Health (J&J)) was initialized and calibrated. Registration accuracy measured 2.2mm. The articulating catheter was maneuvered to the LUL inferior lingula (B5) target zone.\n\nRadial ultrasound miniprobe was deployed, yielding eccentric visualization of the lesion. Instrument-within-target was verified via cbct.\n\nTISSUE ACQUISITION:\n- Grasping forceps specimens acquired: 8\n- Aspiration needle passes executed: 4  \n- Cytology brushings harvested: 2\n- Lavage fluid extracted from LUL\n\nROSE assessment yielded: Malignant - small cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMEN DISPOSITION\n- EBUS aspirates dispatched to: Cytology, cell block, flow cytometry\n- Parenchymal samples dispatched to: Surgical pathology, molecular analysis\n- Brushings dispatched to: Cytology\n- Lavage dispatched to: Microbiology (bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal)\n\nOUTCOME ASSESSMENT\nProcedure concluded without adverse events. Hemorrhage: negligible (<10mL). Post-procedure radiograph: unremarkable, pneumothorax excluded.\n\nDISPOSITION\nPatient [REDACTED] recovery suite. Discharged to residence following observation period. Outpatient follow-up scheduled for pathology review.\n\nSUMMARY\n1. EBUS-guided mediastinal staging successfully executed (4 stations sampled)\n2. Robotic navigation to peripheral target successfully accomplished\n3. Tissue acquisition achieved via multiple modalities\n4. Zero procedural complications documented\n\nElectronically attested,\nSarah Chen, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nAcademic Health System"
