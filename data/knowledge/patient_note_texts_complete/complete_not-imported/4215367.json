The visualized portion of the trachea is of normal caliber. The carina is sharp. The tracheobronchial tree was examined to at least the first subsegmental level. Bronchial mucosa and anatomy are normal; there are no endobronchial lesions.\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Bronchus Intermedius, Right Mainstem, RUL Carina (RC1), Left Carina (LC2) from mucus.\n\nCT Chest scan was placed on separate planning station to generate 3D rendering of the pathway to target. The navigational plan was reviewed and verified. This was then loaded into robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nVentilation Parameters:\nMode\tRR\tTV\tPEEP\tFiO2\tFlow Rate\tPmean\nVCV\t12\t320\t9\t80\t5\t18\n\nRobotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed with Ion platform. Full registration was used. Registration error: 2.5mm. Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the Inferior Lingula (LB5). Target lesion is approximately 11mm in diameter. Under navigational guidance the Ion robotic catheter was advanced to 1.3cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location. rEBUS view: Eccentric. Continuous margin noted.\n\nThe robotic arm was actively locked to maintain rigidity. Vision probe was unlocked and removed from the working channel, leaving the outer catheter locked in position via shape-sensing technology.\n\nTransbronchial needle aspiration was performed with 21G and 23G Needle through the extended working channel catheter. Total 4 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology and Cell block.\n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with 1.7mm cryoprobe via the extended working channel catheter. Freeze time of 5 seconds was used. Total 6 samples were collected. Samples sent for Pathology.\n\nTransbronchial brushing was performed with protected cytology brush through the extended working channel catheter. Total 2 samples were collected. Samples sent for Cytology.\n\nROSE Result: Malignant cells id[REDACTED], consistent with adenocarcinoma\n\nVision probe was re-inserted to inspect the airway. No significant bleeding observed. The catheter was retracted. Final airway inspection showed no complications.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\nDISPOSITION: Recovery, then discharge if stable. CXR to rule out pneumothorax.\nFollow-up: Results conference in 5-7 days.\n\nMartinez, MD"
