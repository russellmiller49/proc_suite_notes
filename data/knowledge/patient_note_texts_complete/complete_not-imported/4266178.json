  "4266178": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION\n\nPatient [REDACTED]: Ronald James\nMedical Record [REDACTED]: [REDACTED]\nDate of Birth: [REDACTED] (Age: 51 years)\nBiological Sex: Male\nDate of Procedure: [REDACTED]\nInstitution: [REDACTED]\n\nCLINICAL PRESENTATION AND PROCEDURAL INDICATION\n\nThis 51-year-old male patient with a pertinent oncologic history presented for comprehensive bronchoscopic evaluation. The primary indication for this procedure encompassed right upper lobe mass with ipsilateral mediastinal nodes. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 31.9 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8), with negative bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 13.4.\n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Pentax EB-1990i) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 11L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.6 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 2L demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 14.5 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 7 demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 21.8 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes. Station 11R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.0 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 3 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - small cell carcinoma. Station 10R demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 21.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 22-gauge Acquire needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy platform (Intuitive Surgical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 3.2 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LLL anteromedial basal (B7+8).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated adjacent visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via fluoroscopy.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (6 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (3 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed suspicious for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 5 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LLL pulmonary lesion\n3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of suspicious for malignancy\n4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed\n\nTotal Procedure Duration: 119 minutes\n\nElectronically Signed,\nMaria Santos, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nMemorial Hospital"
