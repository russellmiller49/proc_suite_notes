Lung nodule/mass requiring tissue diagnosis\n2. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy requiring staging\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nSame as preoperative, pending final pathology\n\nPROCEDURES PERFORMED\n1. Linear endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for mediastinal staging\n2. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (Ion platform) with peripheral lung biopsy\n3. Radial EBUS for peripheral lesion localization\n4. Transbronchial lung biopsy\n\nANESTHESIA\nType: General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation\nASA Class: 3\n\nPROCEDURE START TIME: 10:15\nPROCEDURE END TIME: 11:36\nTOTAL PROCEDURE TIME: 81 minutes\n\nEQUIPMENT\n- Linear EBUS scope: Pentax EB-1990i\n- EBUS needle: Olympus NA-201SX-4022 (22G Standard FNA)\n- Robotic platform: Ion (Intuitive Surgical)\n- Radial EBUS probe: 20 MHz miniprobe\n\nPROCEDURE DETAILS\n\nPART 1: LINEAR EBUS FOR MEDIASTINAL STAGING\n\nThe patient was brought to the procedure suite and placed in supine position. After induction of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation with an 8.0 mm ETT, the linear EBUS bronchoscope was advanced through the ETT.\n\nSystematic mediastinal lymph node sampling was performed at the following stations:\n\nStation 10R: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 15.5mm (short axis) x 31.6mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Suspicious for malignancy.\nStation 10L: Id[REDACTED] hypoechoic lymph node measuring 21.7mm (short axis) x 14.6mm (long axis). 2 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Adequate lymphocytes.\nStation 11R: Id[REDACTED] homogeneous lymph node measuring 20.5mm (short axis) x 29.9mm (long axis). 3 passes performed with 22G needle. ROSE: Malignant - NSCLC NOS.\n\nPART 2: ROBOTIC BRONCHOSCOPY FOR PERIPHERAL LESION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Ion robotic bronchoscopy system was deployed.\n\nTarget lesion: LLL lateral basal (B9)\nLesion characteristics:\n- Size: 29.4 mm\n- Distance from pleura: 20.2 mm\n- CT appearance: Part-solid\n- Bronchus sign: Negative\n\n\nNavigation was performed successfully with registration error < 3mm. The robotic catheter was advanced to the target location. Radial EBUS probe was deployed confirming adjacent view of the lesion.\n\nTool-in-lesion confirmation: Fluoroscopy\n\nSampling performed:\n- Transbronchial forceps biopsies: 6 specimens\n- TBNA: 2 passes\n- Brushings: 2 specimens\n\nROSE result from peripheral lesion: Malignant - squamous cell carcinoma\n\nSPECIMENS COLLECTED\n1. EBUS-TBNA specimens from stations 10R, 10L, 11R - sent for cytology, cell block, and flow cytometry\n2. Transbronchial biopsies from LLL - sent for surgical pathology\n3. Brushings from LLL - sent for cytology\n4. BAL from LLL - sent for cultures (bacterial, fungal, AFB)\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone. No significant bleeding. No pneumothorax noted on post-procedure imaging.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimal (<10 mL)\n\nIMPRESSION\n1. Successful EBUS-TBNA mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic bronchoscopy with peripheral nodule biopsy\n3. ROSE adequate at all sampled sites\n4. Await final pathology and molecular testing if indicated\n\nPLAN\n1. Monitor in recovery for 2 hours\n2. Post-procedure chest X-ray - completed, no pneumothorax\n3. Discharge to home if stable with standard post-bronchoscopy precautions\n4. Results conference scheduled\n5. Final pathology will determine staging and treatment planning\n\nBrian O'Connor\nInterventional Pulmonology\nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital\n\nCPT CODES: 31653, 31627, 31654, 31628\n"
