The primary indication for this procedure encompassed lung cancer staging - suspected nsclc with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Preprocedural imaging demonstrated a 23.2 mm ground-glass pulmonary parenchymal lesion localized to the LLL lateral basal (B9), with positive bronchus sign on computed tomographic assessment. Positron emission tomography demonstrated metabolic hyperactivity with standardized uptake value maximum of 16.0.\n\nANESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe patient was classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 3. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered, with successful orotracheal intubation utilizing a 8.0 mm endotracheal tube.\n\nPROCEDURAL TECHNIQUE\n\nCOMPONENT I: ENDOBRONCHIAL ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TRANSBRONCHIAL NEEDLE ASPIRATION\n\nThe convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope (Olympus BF-UC180F) was advanced through the endotracheal tube into the tracheobronchial tree. Systematic mediastinal and hilar lymph node evaluation was performed according to established staging protocols.\n\nStation 11R demonstrated a homogeneous lymph node measuring 13.7 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed suspicious for malignancy. Station 2L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 8.4 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 2 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - nsclc nos. Station 4L demonstrated a heterogeneous lymph node measuring 19.6 mm in short axis diameter. Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed utilizing 4 passes with a 19-gauge FNB/ProCore needle. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation revealed malignant - adenocarcinoma.\n\nCOMPONENT II: ROBOTIC-ASSISTED BRONCHOSCOPIC NAVIGATION\n\nFollowing completion of mediastinal staging, the Galaxy robotic bronchoscopy platform (Noah Medical) was deployed. Electromagnetic navigation registration achieved acceptable accuracy with registration error of 2.8 mm. The robotic catheter was successfully advanced to the target lesion in the LLL lateral basal (B9).\n\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography demonstrated eccentric visualization of the target lesion. Tool-in-lesion confirmation was achieved via radial ebus.\n\nTissue acquisition was performed utilizing multiple modalities: transbronchial forceps biopsy (7 specimens), transbronchial needle aspiration (2 passes), and bronchial brushings (2 specimens). Bronchoalveolar lavage was obtained for microbiological analysis.\n\nRAPID ON-SITE CYTOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n\nOn-site cytopathological assessment of the peripheral lesion specimens revealed suspicious for malignancy.\n\nPROCEDURAL OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS\n\nThe procedure was completed without complication. Hemostasis was achieved spontaneously with minimal blood loss (<10 mL). Post-procedural chest radiography demonstrated no evidence of pneumothorax or other acute pulmonary parenchymal abnormality.\n\nIMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. Successful endobronchial ultrasound-guided mediastinal staging with sampling of 3 lymph node stations\n2. Successful robotic-assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of LLL pulmonary lesion\n3. Cytological evaluation suggestive of suspicious for malignancy\n4. Recommend correlation with final surgical pathology and consideration of molecular profiling if malignancy confirmed\n\nTotal Procedure Duration: 105 minutes\n\nElectronically Signed,\nJennifer Walsh, MD\nDivision of Interventional Pulmonology\nBaptist Medical Center"
