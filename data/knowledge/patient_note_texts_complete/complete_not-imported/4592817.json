The flexible scope was introduced through the rigid barrel. Electrocautery snare was used to resect the dominant polypoid masses. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) was applied to the tumor base for destruction and hemostasis. Luminal patency was restored to approximately 90%.",

We used a rigid bronchoscope to control the airway and then used a snare to cut away the large tumors. We cleaned up the base of the tumors with argon plasma coagulation. By the end, his airway was wide open. He had refused a stent, so we rely on his chemotherapy to prevent regrowth.",

Right-sided pleural effusion causing moderate dyspnea.\n\n**PRE-PROCEDURE:**\n- Informed consent obtained with discussion of increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia (platelets 68K) and coagulopathy (INR 1.7)\n- Timeout performed\n- Point-of-care ultrasound revealed right pleural effusion, maximum depth 6.5 cm\n- Labs reviewed: Platelets 68K, INR 1.7, Creatinine 1.2\n- Vital signs: BP 118/72, HR 76, SpO2 91% on 2L NC\n\n**PROCEDURE DETAILS:**\n- Patient positioned sitting, leaning forward\n- Right lateral chest, 7th intercosal space, posterior axillary line\n- Chlorhexidine skin prep\n- Local anesthesia: 12 mL of 1% lidocaine\n- Ultrasound-guided insertion of 8-French catheter system\n- Initial fluid: transudative appearance, clear yellow\n- Volume removed: 800 mL (stopped due to concern for re-expansion pulmonary edema)\n- Drainage rate kept slow (less than 1000 mL/hour)\n- Post-procedure ultrasound: no pneumothorax\n\n**SPECIMENS SENT:**\n- Pleural fluid analysis (cell count, protein, LDH, albumin)\n- Pleural fluid culture\n\n**IMMEDIATE RESULTS:**\n- Appearance: Clear, yellow, transudative\n- Estimated protein <2.5 g/dL based on appearance\n\n**POST-PROCEDURE:**\n- Procedure well tolerated\n- No immediate complications\n- Vital signs: BP 122/74, HR 78, SpO2 94% on 2L NC\n- Patient reports significant improvement in breathing\n\n**COMPLICATIONS:** None\n\n**ASSESSMENT:** Successful therapeutic thoracentesis of recurrent hepatic hydrothorax. Limited drainage to 800 mL to minimize risk of complications given underlying coagulopathy and hepatic disease.\n\n**PLAN:**\n- Continue diuretic optimization\n- Discuss with hepatology regarding TIPS evaluation\n- Consider repeat thoracentesis vs IPC if rapid reaccumulation\n- Sodium restriction and fluid management"
