ANESTHESIA: 
99152 Moderate sedation: initial 15 minutes
99153 Moderate sedation: each additional 15 minutes 
Procedure performed under moderate sedation.  
 
The following medications were provided:
Versed             4 mg
Fentanyl          100 mcg
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia start time:   11:50
 
Physician/patient face-to-face anesthesia stop time:   12:20
 
Total moderate sedation time was 30 minutes.  
 
Patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.   Sedation was administered by RN. 
 
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
 
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
 
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
 
COMPLICATIONS:    None
 
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
 
PATIENT POSITION: . 
 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
 
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , and Left Mainstem from mucus. 
 
Upper airway was suctioned and cleared.  Endotracheal suctioning performed.  The cuff was deflated and the tracheostomy tube was easily removed.  The stoma appeared widely patent and no granulation tissue was immediately visualized.  The new tracheostomy tube was then placed with obturator in place.  The obturator was removed, inner cannula was placed and the cuff inflated.
 
Percutaneous tracheostomy was changed from:
Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 8.0mm
 
To 
Portex cuffed Trach ISO/ID size 8.0mm
 
without issue.
 
Tracheobronchoscopy was performed with insertion of bronchoscope through the tracheostomy to perform airway clearance and confirm tracheostomy position. 
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.
