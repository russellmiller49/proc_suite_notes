PROCEDURE FINDINGS: 
A  pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of minimal serous appearing pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle pointed in the apical posterior direction. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trochar) was advanced over the guidewire. The catheter was inserted into the chest until all catheter holes were well within the chest. The guidewire and trochar were then removed.  The tube was then attached to the collection drain apparatus and secured in place with suture and covered.
