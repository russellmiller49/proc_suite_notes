NOTE_ID:  note_081 SOURCE_FILE: note_081.txt INDICATION FOR OPERATION:  [REDACTED]is a 48 year old-year-old female who presents with dyspnea.  The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.  
 
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  R91.8 Other nonspecific abnormal finding of lung field.
PROCEDURE:  
31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode
31622 Dx bronchoscope/cell washing          
31625 Endobronchial Biopsy(s)
ANESTHESIA: 
General Anesthesia
MONITORING : Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.
INSTRUMENT : 
Disposable Bronchoscope
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   None
COMPLICATIONS:    None
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).   
PATIENT POSITION: . 
Initial Airway Inspection Findings:
The airway was inspected. The vocal cords were normal appearing. Lidocaine was applied to the vocal cords and the airway. The airway anatomy was notable for scarring at the subglottic space, the previous site of stenosis. There was minimal narrowing at this site. There remainder of the airway was normal appearing to the segmental level bilaterally.
Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Vocal Cord, Subglottic, Trachea (Proximal 1/3), Trachea (Middle 1/3), Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius , Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina (RC1), RML Carina (RC2), LUL Lingula Carina (Lc1), and Left Carina (LC2) from mucus. 
Endobronchial biopsy was performed at Subglottic.  Lesion was successfully removed.  Samples sent for Pathology.
 
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.  At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. 
SPECIMEN(S): 
Subglottic endobronchial biopsies
IMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED]is a 48 year old-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for dyspnea.
