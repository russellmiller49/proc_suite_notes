APC	 	 	 	 
Laser	 	 	 	 
CoreCath	 	 	 	 
Cryoprobe	 	 	 	 
Balloon dilation was performed at right middle lobe orifice.  6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the right middle lobe orifice.  Total 3 inflations with dilation time of 60 seconds each.
Prior to treatment, affected airway was note to be 10% patent.  After treatment, the airway was 100% patent.
