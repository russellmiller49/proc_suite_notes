IP [REDACTED] CODE MOD DETAILS: 
Unusual Procedure (22 MODIFIER):
This patient required the following at 3 different/discrete sites, although all 3 sites were within the same lobe they were in 
distinct/different locations within the lobe:  robotic navigational bronchoscopy to the different sites, brushings, radial EBUS, CT-guided needle placement, transbronchial needle aspiration, transbronchial cryo biopsies.
The patient required the following at 2 different/discrete sites:  bronchoalveolar lavage.
The patient required ultrasound elastrography evaluation of 7 different/discrete sites (6 lymph node sites and 1 adrenal mass site), with the images/interpretation used for intraprocedural decision-making;
this also extended the time necessary for the EBUS procedure and extended the time necessary for the EUS-B procedure.
This resulted in >150% increased work due to Increased intensity, Time, Technical difficulty of procedure, and Physical and mental effort required.

EBUS-Findings
Indications: Diagnostic and Staging
Technique:
All lymph node stations were assessed.
Only those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled, or if otherwise concerning appearing.
Lymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle and 21-gauge Needle.
Lymph Nodes/Sites Inspected: 
4R (lower paratracheal) node - Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography mode was performed on this lymph node to assess its stiffness and tissue characteristics, and to identify different densities in this target lymph node.
Semi-qualitivative analysis of this lymph node demonstrated a Type 1 elastograpic pattern, predominantly soft (green/yellow), suggesting a reactive or benign process.
The elastography interpretation was separate from the typical interpretation of linear EBUS ultrasound images.
Along with the lymph node size, the elastographic pattern information/interpretation was used to make the decision to not perform transbronchial sampling of this lymph node.
