Residual secretions were suctioned to cleared (therapeutic aspiration).\nEGD findings:\nEGD was performed to assess for esophageal or gastric in context of suspected new or recurrent cancer and to assess safety of advancing EBUS scope for EUS-B procedure.\nFlexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced with the assistance of air insufflation, and allowing for dilation to the lumen for better intraluminal evaluation.\nThe esophagus was normal, GEJ normal, stomach was normal with mild amount of green bilious-appearing secretions, which were suctioned to clear.\nThe pyloric sphincter was assessed and normal.  The duodenum was not assessed.\nBased on findings, no concerning lesions suggestion of esophageal or gastric malignancy and safe to proceed with EUS-B procedure.\nAir was exsufflated while removing the scope.\n \nEUS-B Findings\nEUS-B was performed to assess concerning left adrenal mass in context of suspected new or recurrent cancer.\nIndications: Diagnostic and Staging\nTechnique:\nThe left adrenal mass was assessed. It was >10mm in size, and was sampled.\nThe EUS-B scope was advanced with the assistance of air insufflation.\nThe left adrenal mass evaluation was performed via endoscopic-ultrasound with EBUS bronchoscope (EUS-B) and sampling by transesophageal/transgastric needle aspiration was performed using 25-gauge Needle.\nSites Inspected: \nleft adrenal mass\n \nOverall EUS-B transesophageal/transgastric ROSE Diagnosis: \"Lesional\"\n \nEUS-B Sites Sampled:\nSite 1: The left adrenal mass was > 10 mm on CT  and Hypermetabolic via PET-CT scan in 7/2025.\nThe left adrenal mass was photographed.\nElastography:  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography mode was performed to assess lymph node stiffness and tissue characteristics, and to identify different densities in this target lymph node.\nSemi-qualitivative analysis of this lymph node demonstrated a Type 2 elastographic pattern with mixed soft (green/yellow) and stiff (blue) regions.\nGiven this heterogeneous and indeterminate appearance, TBNA was directed at representative areas to ensure comprehensive sampling and to minimize the risk of underdiagnosis.\nThe elastography interpretation was separate from the typical interpretation of linear EBUS ultrasound images.\nAlong with the lymph node size, the elastographic pattern interpretation was used to make the decision to perform transbronchial sampling of this lymph node and where to guide/location sampling within the lymph node.\nThis image was store and archived.  \nSampling:  The site was sampled.. 4 endoscopic ultrasound guided transbronchial biopsies were performed with samples obtained.\nSent for cytology.  \nEvidence of small hematoma forming around the adrenal mass on EUS-B evaluation.  Therefore, no further tissue obtained.\nPreliminary ROSE Cytology was reported as adequate and \"Lesional\". Final results are pending.\nThe EUS-B scope was withdrawn and the Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope readvanced into esophagus and stomach with the assistance of air insufflation for repeat assessment.\nNo evidence of mucosal or intraluminal bleeding.  Air was exsufflated while removing the scope.\n \nBronchoscope was removed.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.\nAt the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:   Minimal\nCOMPLICATIONS:     None\n \nSPECIMEN(S): \n-Right upper lobe apical segment nodule #1 - peripheral subsolid nodule with increasing density (labeled as RUL #1): TBNA (cytology and cultures), TBCBx (pathology and tissue culture), Brushing (cytology), Mini-BAL (cultures)\n-Right upper lobe apical segment nodule #2 - more central subsolid nodule (labeled as RUL #2): TBNA (cytology and cultures), TBCBx (pathology and tissue culture), Brushing (cytology), Mini-BAL (cultures)\n-Right upper lobe posterior segment (RB2) subpleural subsolid nodule (labeled as RUL #3): TBNA (cytology and cultures), TBCBx (pathology and tissue culture), Brushing (cytology), Mini-BAL (cultures)\n-RUL RB1 (apical segment) BAL: \n cell count, micro, and cytology\n-RUL RB2 (posterior segment) BAL:  cell count, micro, and cytology\n-EBUS TBNA of 11L lymph node, 7 (subcarinal) node, 11Rs lymph node, 11Ri lymph node:  cytology for each\n-EUS-B transesopagheal/transgastric needle aspiration of left adrenal mass:  cytology\n \nIMPRESSION/PLAN: [REDACTED] is a 81 year old-year-old male who presents for bronchoscopy for biopsy of multiple lung nodules, lymph node assessment, and left adrenal mass assessment.\n-Obtain post-procedure CXR (ordered)\n-Follow-up in IP clinic to review results in 1-2 weeks.\n"}
