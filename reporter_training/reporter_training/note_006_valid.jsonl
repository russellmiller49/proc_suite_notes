Anatomy was normal with no intervening vessels identified on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the bilateral mainstems and lower lobes from blood-tinged mucus.\n\nPercutaneous Tracheostomy:\nThe bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized. Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n\nLidocaine 1% (5 mL) was injected into the anterior neck. A 1.5 cm incision was made vertically with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage.

No abnormal vasculature was identified in the surgical field on examination from the laryngeal prominence to the sternal notch.\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration:\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina from copious secretions.\n\nPercutaneous Tracheostomy:\nThe bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized. Next, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n\nLidocaine 1% (4 mL) was injected into the anterior neck. A 1.5 cm incision was made vertically with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage. The introducer needle was passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization. This needle was removed, and the introducer catheter over needle was advanced.\n\nNext, a J-wire was passed through the catheter, also visualized with the bronchoscope. The site was then dilated using the 14 Fr introducing dilator passed over the wire. The 14 Fr dilator was then removed from the guide wire and an 8 Fr guiding catheter placed over the guide wire until the safety ridge on the guiding catheter was at skin level. A Portex dilator was placed over the guiding catheter until the positioning mark was visualized via the bronchoscope. The Portex dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.\n\nFinally, a Portex 8.0 tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place.\n\nTracheobronchoscopy via Tracheostomy:\nTracheobronchoscopy was performed with insertion of bronchoscope through the tracheostomy to perform airway clearance and confirm tracheostomy position.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Endotracheal tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube.
