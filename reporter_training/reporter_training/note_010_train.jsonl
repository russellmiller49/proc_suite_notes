Cryotherapy utilized.", "completion": "NOTE_ID:  note_010 SOURCE_FILE: note_010.txt\n\nINTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT \n\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: [Date] \n\nINDICATION FOR OPERATION  [REDACTED] is a 24-year-old female who presents with recurrent hemoptysis.\nThe nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.\nThe patient wished to proceed and informed consent was obtained. \n\nCONSENT  Obtained before the procedure.\nIndications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.\nThe patient or surrogate read and signed the provided consent form or provided consent over the phone.\nThe consent was witnessed by an assisting medical professional. \n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS \nJ98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS \nJ98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n\nPROCEDURE \nTherapeutic aspiration (subsequent episodes) (CPT 31646) \nDestruction of tumor or relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (e.g., laser therapy, cryotherapy) (CPT 31641) \n\nANESTHESIA  Moderate sedation (CPT 99152).\nMedications: Propofol 100 mg; Fentanyl 50 mcg.\n\nTime: Start 1450; Stop 1510 (Total 20 minutes).\nAssessment: The patient was monitored continuously one-to-one throughout the entire procedure by the attending physician while anesthesia was administered.\nMONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and blood pressure were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the procedure.\nINSTRUMENTATION  Flexible Hybrid (Pediatric) Bronchoscope; Cryoprobe system; Uniblocker. \n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None \n\nCOMPLICATIONS None \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming patient identity, planned procedures, and laterality.\nPatient Position: Supine \n\nInitial Airway Inspection: \n\nTracheostomy: The tracheostomy tube was in good position.\nPharynx/Larynx/Vocal Cords: Not assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through tracheostomy tube.\n\nTrachea: Distal 1/3 normal.\n\nMain Carina: Sharp.\nLeft Lung: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level. Thin rusty secretions were noted.\nMinor mucosal thickening noted in LB1/2.\n\nRight Lung: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level mostly.\nHowever, an endobronchial balloon was noted at the RUL/Apical Segment with organized clot obscuring evaluation of distal airways.\nA 9Fr Arndt blocker was noted in the middle of the right mainstem (RMS); the balloon was deflated.\n\nMucosa: Normal.\nSecretions: Minimal, thin, and clear (aside from specific areas noted).\nTherapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Right Mainstem, Carina, LUL Carina (Lc1), LLL Carina (LC2), RUL Carina (RC1), and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots.\n\nEndobronchial Blocker Placement A 5Fr Uniblocker balloon occlusion was performed at the Right Carina (RC1) and secured in place with the Uniblocker ventilator adaptor.\nPlacement: At the tape level at dark blue securement device.\nInflation: Confirmed that 3 cc of air was required to inflate the balloon to fully occlude the RUL.\nThe endobronchial blocker balloon was intermittently inflated in the RUL to assist with clot removal.\n\nCryo-Extraction of Mucus Casts/Secretions A 2.4 mm cryoprobe was applied to adherent organized clot at the RUL/Apical Segment.\nTechnique: 5\u201310 second freeze cycles. \n\nResult: Excellent clot removal. The airway was cleared with improved ventilation.\n\nHemostasis and Conclusion After the organized clot was removed from the RUL orifice, the blocker balloon was deflated.\nNo blood was noted coming from RB1, RB2 or RB3. The blocker was left deflated.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. \n\nSPECIMENS  None\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN \n[REDACTED] is a 24-year-old female who presented for bronchoscopy for evaluation of recurrent hemoptysis.\nCryotherapy (cryoprobe) successfully used to evacuate the RUL airways of organized clot.\n5Fr Uniblocker was placed and left deflated at the RUL.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications. \n\nPRN bronchoscopy as needed.\nDecannulation as appropriate.\n"}
