Main Carina: Sharp.\n\nLeft Lung: Proximal airways demonstrated normal anatomic branching to the segmental level.\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or other endobronchial pathology.\n\nRight Lung: Endobronchial balloon noted at RUL and RML with organized clot obscuring evaluation.\nOtherwise, normal anatomic branching to segmental level.\n\nMucosa/Secretions: Mucosa normal. Secretions were minimal, thin, and clear.\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration & Clot Removal: \nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Trachea (Distal 1/3), Left Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Right Mainstem, Carina, Left Carina (LC2), and RUL Carina (RC1) and RML Carina (RC2) from mucus, blood, and blood clots.\nOrganized endobronchial clot at the RUL, RML, and RB6 was treated using a 2.4mm cryoprobe (3-5 second freezes), resulting in excellent clot removal.\n\nInstillation & Occlusion: \nAfter organized clot was removed from the RUL, Amphotericin (50mg in 10cc sterile water) was instilled into the RUL proper.\nThe bronchoscope was wedged into the RUL to prevent backflow for 5 minutes.\nTranexamic Acid (TXA) 400mg was applied directly into the RUL.\nBalloon occlusion was performed at the RUL Carina (RC1) and RML Carina (RC2) with a 7 Fr Uniblocker.\nThe blocker was secured at 25.0cm (dark blue securement device), and inflation with 4.0cc of air was confirmed to fully occlude the RUL.\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN: \n56-year-old male evaluated for complex aspergilloma and aspergilloma.\nRUL and RUL, RML, and RB6 airways successfully evacuated of organized clot using a combination of cold saline and cryotherapy.\nAmphotericin instilled into RUL; 7 Fr Uniblocker placed and left inflated at the RUL.\n\nPost-procedure Plan:\nObtain post-procedure Chest X-Ray.\nLeave Uniblocker in place for 6 hours post-procedure (deflate at 1200 on 2026-01-20).\nPlan for repeat bronchoscopy and likely repeat instillation of Amphotericin on 2026-01-22.\n\nNo immediate complications occurred.\n"}
