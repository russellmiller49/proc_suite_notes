The LUL remained largely filled with clot.\nAs the LUL fungal ball (Aspergilloma) is the suspected source of the bleed, the LUL clot was intentionally left in place to organize and prevent further bleeding.\nEndobronchial Hemostasis To prevent recurrence of active bleeding, the following medications were instilled into the LUL targeting LB1/2 and LB3:\n\nEpinephrine: 0.5mg\n\nTranexamic Acid (TXA): 2g\n\nBronchial Blocker Placement A 7Fr Arndt Blocker was utilized.\nThe ventilator adaptor was attached to the tracheostomy tube. Using a parallel Slim disposable scope via the tracheostomy tube, the bronchial blocker balloon was guided into the distal LMSB under direct visualization.\nPosition: Secured at 27cm at the dark blue securement device.\nInflation Test: Confirmed that 8cc of air was required to adequately inflate the balloon and fully occlude the LMSB.\nStatus: The balloon was deflated and left in the distal LMSB for emergent use in case of recurrent massive hemoptysis.\nConclusion Residual secretions and saline were suctioned to clear. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.\nRespiratory status was improved at the conclusion of the operation.\n\nSPECIMENS None.\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration and foreign body removal of clot from LMSB and LLL;\nLUL clot left in situ to tamponade suspected fungal bleeding source.\n\nBronchial blocker placed in distal LMSB, currently deflated.\nPost-Procedure Orders:\n\nNebulized TXA.\n\nHold all anticoagulation (including heparin gtt).\n\nMaintain sedation to limit coughing.\n\nContinue broad-spectrum antimicrobials.\nFollow-up: Tentative plan for repeat bronchoscopy tomorrow for therapeutic aspiration/cryoextraction of clot."}
