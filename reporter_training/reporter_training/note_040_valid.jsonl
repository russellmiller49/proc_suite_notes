The patient indicated a wish to proceed with the procedure and informed consent was signed.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\n\nSymptomatic Pleural Effusion\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\n\nSymptomatic Pleural Effusion\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nUltrasound, chest (includes mediastinum), real time with image documentation (Bilateral)\n\nAspirate pleura with imaging (Thoracentesis)\n\nANESTHESIA Local ONLY.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None (implied by complication status).\n\nCOMPLICATIONS None.\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL\n\nPatient Position: Sitting.\n\nFocused Thoracic Ultrasound (Pleura & Lung) Focused thoracic ultrasound was performed and images were saved and uploaded to the patient's medical record.\n\nLeft Chest Findings:\n\nPleural Effusion: Trace to small effusion, no tappable pocket.\n\nDiaphragm: Normal motion.\n\nLung: Lung sliding was present before and after the procedure. No consolidation or atelectasis was present.\n\nPleura: Normal.\n\nRight Chest Findings:\n\nPleural Effusion: Significant volume, hypoechoic, free-flowing fluid.\n\nDiaphragm: Normal motion.\n\nLung: Lung sliding was present before and after the procedure. Lower lobe consolidation visible.\n\nPleura: Normal.\n\nThoracentesis Based on ultrasound evaluation, thoracentesis was determined to be feasible and proceeded as planned.\n\nThe insertion site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. A thoracentesis kit was used.\n\nAnesthesia: 10 mL of Lidocaine 1% was administered.\n\nEntry Site: Right 8th Intercostal Space at the Posterior-axillary line.\n\nProcedure Findings:\n\nFluid Removed: 600 mL.\n\nAppearance: Serous.\n\nNotes: Drainage was stopped due to patient started coughing.\n\nDrainage Device: Pleurovac.\n\nSuction: No suction used.\n\nClosure: The site was not sutured.\n\nSPECIMENS Fluid was submitted for the following analyses:\n\npH\n\nLDH\n\nGlucose\n\nTotal Protein\n\nCholesterol\n\nCell Count\n\nADA\n\nGram Stain/Culture\n\nAFB\n\nFungal Culture\n\nCytology\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n\nThe patient is a 55-year-old female who presented for Chest Ultrasound and Thoracentesis.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.\n\nThere were no immediate complications.\n\nPost-procedure chest x-ray (CXR) ordered.\n\nFollow up pleural studies.\n\nContinued care per primary team.\n\nDisposition: Nursing Unit.\n"}
