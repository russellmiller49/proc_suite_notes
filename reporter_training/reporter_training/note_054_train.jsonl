Sedation used: Midazolam 4 mg etc.", "completion": "INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT\n\nDATE OF PROCEDURE: January 20, 2026 INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 52-year-old male who presents with Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure with hypoxia.\nThe nature, purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.\nThe patient indicated a wish to proceed with surgery, and informed consent was signed.\n\nCONSENT: Obtained before the procedure.\nIts indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.\nThe consent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: * J96.21 Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure with hypoxia\n\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: * J96.21 Acute on Chronic Respiratory Failure with hypoxia\n\nStoma patent and healthy\n\n\nPROCEDURE: * 31645 Therapeutic aspiration initial episode \n\n31624 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) \n\n31502 Tracheotomy tube change prior to establishment of fistula tract\n\n\nATTENDING: Dr. Hudson ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation (99152, 99153) administered by ICU RN.\nMedications: Midazolam 4 mg, Fentanyl 200 mcg, Dexmedetomidine infusion.\n\n\nTotal Sedation Time: 63 minutes.\nMONITORING: Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer throughout the entire procedure.\nThe patient was monitored one-to-one by the attending physician during anesthesia.\nINSTRUMENT: Flexible Diagnostic Bronchoscope \n\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None \n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed to confirm patient identity and procedure.\nPatient Position: Supine \n\nInitial Airway Inspection:\n\n\nTracheostomy tube: In good position.\n\n\nPharynx/Larynx/Trachea: Normal.\n\n\nVocal Cords: Normal without mass or lesions.\nMain Carina: Sharp.\n\n\nBronchial Tree: Normal anatomic branching to the segmental level bilaterally;\nno evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding, or endobronchial pathology.\n\n\nMucosa/Secretions: Normal mucosa; minimal, thin, clear secretions.\nTherapeutic Aspiration and Lavage: Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the subglottic area, trachea, bilaterally mainstems, and segmental carinas.\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the lateral (RB4) and medial (RB5) of the RML.\n30 cc of NS was instilled with a return of 10 cc.\nTracheostomy Tube Change: The upper airway and endotracheal space were suctioned.\nThe cuff was deflated and the existing Portex cuffed size 7.5 mm tube was removed. The stoma appeared widely patent;\nhowever, the stoma appeared widely patent, clean, and without signs of infection or breakdown.\n\nRoutine cleaning was performed.\nA new Shiley cuffed size 7.5 mm tracheostomy tube was placed with an obturator, which was then replaced with an inner cannula and the cuff inflated.\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition at the conclusion.\nSPECIMENS: * RML BAL (Cell count, microbiology, cytology) \n\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN: * Successful tracheostomy tube exchange (Portex to Shiley 7.5 mm) and diagnostic bronchoscopy.\nRML BAL performed; results pending.\n\nRoutine tube exchange completed.\nPlan: Routine tracheostomy care; follow up BAL results; continue care per primary team.\n"}
