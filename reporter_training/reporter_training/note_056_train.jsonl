Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nEBUS Inspection & Complication Management\nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA. The patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the subglottic posterior trachea where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging. No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.

With Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified. Decision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Placement\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 6 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 3.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 2 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A Montgomery T-tube was initially selected. However, the stent limbs were too long for the patient's anatomy causing carina obstruction.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mm x 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 18 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum. The scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury. With Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified. Decision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Placement\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 9 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 2.0 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 4 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A studded silicone stent was initially selected. However, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a modified tubular stent measuring 15mm x 40mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 13.5/15/16.5 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 16.5 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent). Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\n\nConclusion\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well.

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nEBUS Inspection & Complication Management\nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA. The patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the posterior membrane just proximal to the carina where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging. No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.

The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 6 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 3.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 2 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A studded silicone stent was initially selected. However, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a modified tubular stent measuring 15mm x 40mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nEBUS Inspection & Complication Management\nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA. The patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the posterior membrane just proximal to the carina where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging. No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum. The scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury. With Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified. Decision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Placement\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 8 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 2.5 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 3 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A silicone Y-stent (15mm x 12mm x 12mm) was initially selected. However, migration occurred immediately upon deployment requiring removal.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular silicone stent measuring 14mm x 40mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 16.5 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 7 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 3.0 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 2.5 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially selected. However, the stent limbs were too long for the patient's anatomy causing carina obstruction.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular silicone stent measuring 14mm x 40mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 15 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nEBUS Inspection & Complication Management\nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA. The patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the posterior membrane just proximal to the carina where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging. No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum. The scope was subsequently introduced into the esophagus to evaluate for esophageal injury. With Gastroenterology present, the length of the esophagus was examined and no esophageal defect/injury was identified. Decision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Placement\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 9 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 2.0 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 4 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A studded silicone stent was initially selected. However, the stent limbs were too long for the patient's anatomy causing carina obstruction.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular silicone stent measuring 14mm x 40mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 12/13.5/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 18 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

Instilled 40 cc of NS, suction returned with 20 cc of NS. Samples sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nEBUS Inspection & Complication Management\nAfter initial airway inspection and BAL the therapeutic bronchoscope was removed and the linear EBUS scope introduced via the LMA. The patient's trachea was inspected and particular attention was paid to the mid-tracheal posterior wall where suspicious tissue was identified on cross-sectional imaging. No suspicious lesion was identified and no samples were taken.\n\nThe linear EBUS was removed and repeat inspection with the therapeutic scope revealed a full thickness tear in the airway, presumably from the EBUS scope. Advanced Gastroenterology service was consulted intraoperatively and came to the OR for consultation. The defect was observed from within the trachea and the bronchoscope was introduced into the defect where no esophageal lumen was identified, only soft tissue c/w mediastinum.

The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 9 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 2.0 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 4 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A silicone Y-stent (16mm x 13mm x 13mm) was initially selected. However, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mm x 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 13.5/15/16.5 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 16.5 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent).

Decision was then made to place a tracheal stent across the defect and forgo esophageal stenting.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Stent Placement\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, tooth or gum protector was placed. The black long rigid barrel was introduced through the mouth and advanced in the midline. The vocal cords were identified and the rigid bronchoscope was advanced carefully. Once the rigid bronchoscope was positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation (14 DP, 80 F, 100% FiO2) was initiated and chest wall movement was confirmed. Intubation was easy.\n\nMeasurements were taken of the posterior membrane defect as follows:\nDistance from vocal folds to membrane defect: 7 cm\nDistance from top of defect to bottom: 3.0 cm\nDistance of bottom of defect to main carina: 2.5 cm\n\nThe black rigid bronchoscope was removed and the patient was reintubated with the yellow rigid bronchoscope in the standard fashion. A studded silicone stent was initially selected. However, significant difficulty was encountered advancing the stent into the deployer, eventually causing a mild tear of a bronchial limb.\nThus, the stent was modified to a tubular tracheal stent measuring 16mm x 45mm.\nThe modified tracheal stent was loaded on to the rigid stent loader and placed in the trachea. The rigid forceps were then used to grasp the silicone stent and position it squarely across the tracheal defect.\n\nBalloon dilation was performed at Trachea (Distal 1/3) within the silicone stent to seat it in place. 13.5/15/16.5 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 18 mm at the Trachea (Distal 1/3) (within the silicone stent). Total 1 inflations with dilation time of 30 seconds each.\n\nConclusion\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS: LUL BAL (cell count, micro, cyto)\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n[REDACTED] is a 96 year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway occlusion.\nNo occlusion was identified on bronchoscopic evaluation.
