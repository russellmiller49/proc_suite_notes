This included multiple dilations and multiple episodes of excision between other therapeutic modalities. This resulted in double the standard increased work due to increased intensity, time, technical difficulty, and physical/mental effort required.\n\nANESTHESIA General Anesthesia \n\nMONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Radial EBUS; Ion Robotic Bronchoscope; Disposable Bronchoscope; Microwave Ablation Catheter; Cios Spin System.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS Moderate \nCOMPLICATIONS None \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and location.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection The airway was inspected. The trachea and right lung were intact and appropriate to the segmental level. The bronchus intermedius was inflamed and the right upper lobe was visualized; however, the right lower lobe was not visualized initially.\n\nRobotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) \u2014 Right Lower Lobe Target A CT chest scan was placed on a separate planning station to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway to the target. The navigational plan was reviewed, verified, and loaded into the robotic bronchoscopy platform.\n\nNavigation: Robotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration. The Ion robotic catheter was used to engage the presumed orifice of the right lower lobe. The target lesion was approximately 1 cm in diameter, and the catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target under navigational guidance.\n\nRadial EBUS: Radial EBUS was performed to confirm lesion location; it was noted that the target was not well visualized, with soft tissue features noted.\n\nCone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): The Cios Spin system was used for evaluation of the target location. A low-dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging. These images were passed to the Ion platform for reconstruction and nodule location. The 3D images were interpreted on an independent workstation.\n\nAdjustment: Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location. The target airway was visualized, and targets were placed to ensure optimal trajectory of the tools to open the obstructed airway. I personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3D reconstruction.\n\nSpecimen Collection\nTBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 19G needle through the extended working channel. Total 2 samples were collected and sent for Microbiology and Cytology.\nBiopsy: Transbronchial biopsy was performed with the semiconductor precisor through the extended working channel. Total 2 samples were collected and sent for Microbiology and Pathology.\nThe robotic bronchoscope was advanced until the airway lumen was visualized with the vision probe. The catheter was then withdrawn, and the robotic bronchoscope was disconnected.\n\nTherapeutic Bronchoscopy and Airway Recanalization The therapeutic bronchoscope was then used to clear the airway, and the right lung was irrigated with saline.\n\nMechanical Debridement: Granulation tissue and inflamed tissue were excised using the precisor, pulmonary, and large forceps.\n\nBalloon Dilation:\nAn 10/11/12 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 12 mm at the right lower lobe orifice (1 inflation, 60 seconds).\nA 12/13/15 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 13.5 mm at the right lower lobe orifice (3 inflations, 60 seconds each).\n\nMicrowave Ablation: A 2.5 cm microwave catheter was used to ablate the inflamed tissue. Ablation was performed for two minutes (2.8 KJ and 60\u00b0C reached), followed by a pause for further extensive excision, and then a subsequent one-minute ablation (0.9 KJ and 42\u00b0C reached).\n\nAirway Clearance: Serial irrigation with iced saline was performed alongside excision of granulation tissue and blood clot/foreign body.\n\nFinal Inspection Following these interventions, the right upper lobe and the right lower lobe were better visualized.
