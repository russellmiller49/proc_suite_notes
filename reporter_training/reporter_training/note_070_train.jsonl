Indications, potential complications, and alternatives were discussed with the patient or surrogate.\n\nConsent was signed and witnessed by an assisting medical professional.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\n\nD14.31 Benign neoplasm of right bronchus and lung\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\n\nD14.31 Benign neoplasm of right bronchus and lung\n\nROSE conclusive for squamous cell carcinoma \n\nPROCEDURE\n\nTherapeutic aspiration (initial airway clearance) \n\nRobotic navigational bronchoscopy (Ion) to LUL target \n\nBalloon dilation of airway \n\nRadial EBUS (rEBUS) localization \n\nCone-beam CT imaging (Cios Spin) with 3D reconstruction \n\nTBNA of LUL target (6 samples) \n\nTransbronchial biopsy (TBBX) of LUL target (2 samples) \n\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy of LUL target (6 samples) \n\nTransbronchial brushing of LUL target \n\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) \n\nFiducial marker placement \n\nEBUS-TBNA staging (Station 7) with elastography \n\nATTENDING Dr. Bowers\n\nASSISTANT Dr. Jacobs\n\nSUPPORT STAFF RN: S. Jones RT: T. Clark\n\nANESTHESIA General Anesthesia \n\nMONITORING Pulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and \nBP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION Linear EBUS, Radial EBUS, Ion Robotic Bronchoscope, Disposable Bronchoscope, Cios Spin system.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None \n\nCOMPLICATIONS None \n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL After the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location.\n\nInitial Airway Inspection & Therapeutic Aspiration Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, and Left Mainstem from mucus.\n\nRobotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Ion) \u2014 LUL Nodule A CT scan was used to generate a 3D rendering of the pathway, which was verified and loaded into the robotic platform.\n\nRobotic navigation was performed with the Ion platform using partial registration.\n\nThe robotic catheter was used to engage the Apical-Posterior Segment (LB1+2).\n\nThe target lesion measured approximately 0.8 cm in diameter.\n\nBalloon Dilation Significant difficulties were encountered during navigation due to a small carina.\nA 5mm x 20mm Mustang balloon was used to dilate the distal airway under direct fluoro-guidance using Omnipaque 240 as the inflation agent.\n\nFollowing dilation, the robotic bronchoscope was successfully navigated to the distal nodule.\n\nTarget Localization & Confirmation\n\n\nNavigation: The Ion catheter was advanced to 1.0 cm away from the planned target.\n\nRadial EBUS: Performed to confirm location; the nodule appeared Eccentric with a continuous margin.\n\nCone-Beam CT (Cios Spin): A low-dose spin was performed to acquire CT imaging.\n\n3D reconstructions were interpreted on an independent workstation and passed to the Ion platform.\n\nAdjustment: Using the newly acquired nodule location, the Ion robotic system was adjusted to the new targeted location.\n\nI personally interpreted the cone beam CT and 3-D reconstruction.\n\nLUL Target Sampling\n\n\nTBNA: Transbronchial needle aspiration was performed with a 21G needle; total 6 samples collected for Cytology.\n\nForceps Biopsy: Transbronchial biopsy was performed with alligator forceps; total 2 samples collected for Pathology.\n\nCryobiopsy: Transbronchial cryobiopsy was performed with a 1.1mm cryoprobe (6-second freeze time); total 6 samples collected for Pathology.\n\nNote: This patient required Transbronchial Cryobiopsies, resulting in >40% increased work due to technical difficulty and physical/mental effort required.\n\nBrushing: Transbronchial brushing performed with a protected cytology brush; 1 sample collected for Microbiology.\n\nBAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage performed with 40 cc NS instilled and 15 cc returned; sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nFiducial Placement: A fiducial marker (0.8mm x 3mm soft tissue gold CIVCO) was loaded with bone wax and placed under fluoroscopy guidance prior to withdrawal.\n\nROSE (Ion Procedure) conclusive for squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nEBUS STAGING\n\n\nIndications: Diagnostic and Staging. Technique: All lymph node stations were assessed.\n\nOnly those 5 mm or greater in short axis were sampled.\n\nLymph node sizing was performed by EBUS and elastography was used to assess stiffness.\n\nLymph Nodes Evaluated:\n\nStation 11L: < 10 mm. Type 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).\n\nStation 7 (Subcarinal): \u2265 10 mm. Type 2 elastographic pattern (mixed soft and stiff regions). Sampled.\n\nStation 4R (Lower Paratracheal): < 10 mm.\nType 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).\n\nStation 11Rs: < 10 mm.\nType 1 elastographic pattern (predominantly soft/benign). Not sampled (not clinically indicated).\n\n\nAlso Inspected: 4L (lower paratracheal).\n\nCOMPLICATIONS There were no immediate complications.\n\nSPECIMENS\n\nLUL Lung Nodule: TBNA, TBBX (Forceps), TBBX (Cryo), Brush, BAL \n\nStation 7: TBNA \n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n\n71-year-old female with benign neoplasm of right bronchus and lung.\nSuccessful sampling of LUL nodule and Station 7 lymph node.\n\nROSE from lung nodule showed conclusive for squamous cell carcinoma.\nFollow-up results in clinic.\n\nFollow-up CXR.\n"}
