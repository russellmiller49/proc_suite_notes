Initial inspection revealed the endotracheal tube (ETT) in good position, though the tube itself had flaking/peeling plastic along its length.\nThe pharynx, larynx, and vocal cords were not initially assessed due to bronchoscopy introduction through the ETT.\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration and Lavage: Secretions were noted to be a copious, mucoid, and white bilaterally.\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the Distal 1/3 Trachea, Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, and segmental carinas.\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at the Lateral Segment (RB4) and Medial Segment (RB5) of the Right Middle Lobe (RML).\n40 cc of normal saline was instilled with 15 cc returned. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy and Difficult Intubation: A blue rigid barrel tracheoscope was introduced side-by-side with the ETT.\nUpon removal of the ETT, moderate blood was noted in the oropharynx, and there was anterior and Right displacement of the airway.\nThe glottic inlet could not be fully appreciated, and the patient began to desaturate; intubation was aborted and the patient was re-recruited with bag-mask ventilation.\nFor the second attempt, a short barrel was used.\nThe vocal cords were only partially identified, but the rigid bronchoscope was successfully advanced into the trachea.\nOnce positioned at the mid-trachea, jet ventilation was initiated. This process constituted a very challenging rigid bronchoscopy intubation due to deviated upper airway anatomy and stenosis.\n\nFindings: Severe extrinsic compression from the posterior membrane was noted at the distal trachea, displacing the trachea anteriorly.\nStenosis Measurements: Distance from vocal folds to stenosis: 5 mm; Length of stenosis: 3.5 cm;\nDistance from bottom of stenosis to carina: 5.7 cm.\n\nVocal Cords: Right vocal cord erythema/injury was noted.\n\nEBUS Staging and Elastography: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed for diagnostic staging.\nAll lymph node stations were assessed, and those >=5 mm were sampled.\nElastography was used to assess tissue stiffness (Type 1\u20133) to guide biopsy selection.\nStations sampled included: 11Rs, 4R, 7, 4L, 11L.\nPatterns noted included Type 3 elastographic pattern (predominantly stiff/blue), raising concern for malignancy.\nTracheal Mass (>=10mm): 8 EBUS-guided TBNA biopsies and 5 transbronchial cryobiopsies were obtained.\n\nROSE Results: Preliminary ROSE cytology was reported as adequate and suggestive of malignancy.\n\nTracheostomy (ENT Consult): Given the prolonged intubation, distorted anatomy, tracheal stenosis, and possible vocal cord injury, an intraoperative ENT consultation was requested.\nThe ENT team reviewed the case and proceeded with surgical tracheostomy placement under the same anesthesia.\nThe rigid tracheoscope was removed, and the patient underwent fiberoptic intubation with a 7.0 ETT to facilitate the ENT procedure.\n\nConclusion: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.
