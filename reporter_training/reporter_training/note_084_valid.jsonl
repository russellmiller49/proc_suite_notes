The bronchoscope was used to fiberoptically intubate the patient with a size 9 Arndt blocker alongside the endotracheal tube (ETT). The vocal cords were normal in structure and function. Evaluation of the airway was performed; there were no endobronchial lesions and the mucosa was normal. The loop of the endobronchial blocker was moved to the LLL lateral subsegment.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) Bronchial alveolar lavage was performed at the Lingula (LB4). 40 cc of Normal Saline was instilled, and suction returned 35 cc.
