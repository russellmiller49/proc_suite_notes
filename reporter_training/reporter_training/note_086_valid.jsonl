The mucosa appeared erythematous. However, there was no associated granulation tissue and this was overall the best the RML has appeared prior to intervention. Patent RB5/RB5 was visualized.\nRight Lower Lobe: RLL and RB6-10 had normal anatomic branching to the segmental level.\n\nLeft Lung Findings\nAnastomosis: The left anastomosis site was intact with visible intact blue sutures at the site. There was moderate stenosis of the left anastomosis.\nProximal Airways: The LUL bronchus and LB1-3 were normal to the first subsegmental level.\nLingula: Patent and LB4-5 were normal to the first subsegmental level; able to traverse the lingular bronchus with the therapeutic bronchoscope.\n\nInterventions\nTherapeutic Aspiration: Secretions were moderate, mucoid. Successful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucoid secretions from the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, right upper lobe, bronchus intermedius, right middle lobe, right lower lobe, left mainstem bronchus, left upper lobe, and left lower lobe. All secretions were suctioned to clear.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Performed at the Right Middle Lobe (Lateral Segment RB4 and Medial Segment RB5). 30 cc of NS was instilled, and suction returned 10 cc of NS. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology (Cultures/Viral/Fungal), and Cytology.\n\nConclusion\nResidual secretions and saline were suctioned to clear. No bleeding was observed. The bronchoscope was removed. At the conclusion of the operation, the patient's LMA was removed in the operating room and the patient was transported to the recovery room in stable condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications.\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n[REDACTED] is a 68-year-old female who presented for bronchoscopy for airway evaluation and BAL.\nRML bronchus appears overall the best seen at the beginning of bronchoscopy, with no granulation tissue or signs of irritation.\nAlthough unable to traverse with the therapeutic bronchoscope, the RB4 and RB5 subsegments are grossly patent.\nTo avoid undue inflammation, no dilation or other intervention was performed today.\nRepeat bronchoscopy in 4 weeks to confirm stability of the RML bronchus.\nConsideration of interventions depending on the appearance of the airway at that time.\n"}
