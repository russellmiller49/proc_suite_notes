The nature, purpose, risks, benefits and alternatives to Bronchoscopy were discussed with the patient in detail.\n\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nJ98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\n\nPOSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS\nJ98.09 Other diseases of bronchus, not elsewhere classified\nLeft lower lobe bronchial stenosis\n\nPROCEDURE\nTherapeutic aspiration (initial episode) (CPT 31645)\nDestruction of tumor OR relief of stenosis by any method other than excision (e.g. laser therapy, cryotherapy) (CPT 31641)\nBalloon dilation of Left lower lobe orifice\n\nATTENDING Dr. Anderson\nASSISTANT Dr. Garcia\nSUPPORT STAFF RN: Emily RT: John\n\nANESTHESIA General Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING\nPulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\nFlexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope; Argon Plasma Coagulation (probe); Elation balloon (6/7/8).\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS None\nCOMPLICATIONS None\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nPatient Position [Supine]\n\nInitial Airway Inspection\nLeft lower lobe orifice was significantly narrowed. Prior to treatment, the affected airway was noted to be pinpoint patent.\n\nTherapeutic Aspiration\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clean out the proximal airways from mucus.\n\nLeft lower lobe Intervention\nEndobronchial obstruction at the LLL orifice was treated with the following modalities:\n\nArgon Plasma Coagulation: Using Argon Plasma Coagulation probe (setting 30W), cauterization were made for a duration of 4 seconds.\n\nBalloon Dilation: A 6/7/8 Elation balloon was used to perform dilation to 8 mm at the Left lower lobe orifice. Total of 3 inflations were performed with a dilation time of 60 seconds each.\n\nResults\nAfter treatment, the airway was 90% patent.\n\nConclusion\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.
