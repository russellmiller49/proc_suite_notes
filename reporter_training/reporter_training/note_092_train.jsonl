This resulted in >50% increased work due to time, technical difficulty, and physical/mental effort.\n\nATTENDING\n[REDACTED] (Ref: Dr. Smith)\n\nANESTHESIA\nGeneral Anesthesia\n\nMONITORING\nPulse oximetry, heart rate, telemetry, and BP were continuously monitored by an independent trained observer that was present throughout the entire procedure.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\nRigid Bronchoscope; Flexible Therapeutic Bronchoscope.\n\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS\nMinimum\n\nCOMPLICATIONS\nNone\n\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL\nAfter the successful induction of anesthesia, a timeout was performed (confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location).\n\nInitial Flexible Bronchoscopy & Stent Removal\nThe flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced through the Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA), which was in good position.\n\nAirway Inspection: The vocal cords were normal without mass/lesions. The anterior trachea showed a well-healed tracheostomy site but was otherwise normal. The main carina was sharp.\n\nRight Lung: Anastomosis sutures were intact.\nRight lung clear. The BI had a stent in place.\n\nLeft Lung: Normal anatomic branching and no endobronchial pathology.\n\nSecretions: Minimal, thin, and clear.\nSuccessful therapeutic aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the distal trachea, bilateral mainstems, and lobar carinas.\n\nDuring initial gentle suctioning/therapeutic aspiration at the BI, the Covered Ultraflex 8mm x 20mm stent became dislodged and completely extruded from the BI into the central airway.\n\nForeign Body Removal: The stent was grasped with pulmonary forceps and removed en bloc with the therapeutic bronchoscope.\n\nHemostasis: Oozing blood from the distal BI bronchus was noted after dislodgement. Bleeding was easily controlled with endobronchial cold saline, epinephrine 0.2mg, and tranexamic acid 200mg.\n\nRigid Bronchoscopy & Intervention\nAfter induction of muscle relaxants, the LMA was removed and a tooth protector placed. The black bronchoscope ventilating rigid barrel was introduced and advanced to the mid-trachea; jet ventilation was initiated. The barrel was positioned into the proximal mainstem bronchus.\n\nThe area of stenosis at the Bronchus Intermedius was treated with the following modalities:\n\nMechanical Debridement: Pulmonary alligator forceps were used for good granulation tissue removal from the distal BI bronchus.\n\nCryospray: A cryotherapy catheter was used (low-flow) for 3 applications of 10 seconds each, providing excellent application to the distal Bronchus Intermedius and around the take-off.\n\nBalloon Dilation: An 8/9/10 Elation balloon was used to dilate the target airway to 10 mm. Two total inflations were performed with a dilation time of 60 seconds each.\n\nResults: Prior to treatment, the affected airway was 50% patent; after treatment, it was 95% patent. The BI was widely patent with patent segmental airways following extraction, excision, and dilation. The decision was made not to place another stent at this time to allow for a \"stent vacation\" to break the chain of bacterial colonization and observe tissue response to cryospray.\n\nFinal Flexible Bronchoscopy\nThe rigid bronchoscope was extubated and the LMA was replaced by the anesthesia team. The flexible therapeutic bronchoscope was advanced.\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Performed at the BI. 40 cc of NS was instilled with a return of 20 cc. Samples were sent for Cell Count, Microbiology, and Cytology.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to recovery in stable condition.\n\nSPECIMENS\nBI stent (pathology)\nBI BAL (cell count, microbiology, cytology)\n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n[REDACTED] is a 45-year-old female who presents for bronchoscopy for evaluation of airway stenosis. Patient underwent bronchoscopy with stent removal, application of spray cryotherapy, and balloon dilation without immediate complication.\n\nPost-procedure CXR.\nFollow-up BAL results.\nFollow-up in outpatient Interventional Pulmonology clinic as scheduled.\nRepeat bronchoscopy in 2-3 weeks to monitor airway closely.\n"}
