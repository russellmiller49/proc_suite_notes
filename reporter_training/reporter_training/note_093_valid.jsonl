No evidence of mass, lesions, or bleeding elsewhere.\nLeft Lung Proximal Airways: Normal anatomic branching to segmental level. No mass, lesions, or bleeding.\nTherapeutic Aspiration: Successful aspiration was performed to clear mucus from the Trachea, Right Mainstem, Bronchus Intermedius, Left Mainstem, Carina, RUL Carina, LUL Lingula Carina, and Left Carina.\nRML Recanalization and Stent Removal The RML was initially unidentifiable, with suspicion that the stent had migrated distally with tissue overgrowth.\nLocalization: The EBUS scope was utilized to identify the RML orifice and distal stent.\nAccess: Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) was utilized to re-create/re-open the RML orifice.\nInspissated mucus was aspirated from the RML during this maneuver.\nDissection: Following the creation of a pinhole opening via TBNA, pulmonary forceps were used to probe and blunt dissect to widen the opening.\nBiopsy/Excision: Endobronchial biopsy was performed at the RML, and the lesion/tissue was successfully removed.\nDilation: A 4Fr Fogarty balloon was inserted to further open the RML. Purulent secretions distal to the obstruction were aspirated.\nDistal Inspection & Lavage: The hybrid scope was used to explore the distal RML, successfully identifying the medial and lateral subsegments.\nBAL was performed at the Lateral (RB4) and Medial (RB5) segments.\n\nInstilled 40 cc NS; returned 25 cc.\nBalloon Dilation: Performed at RML Carina (RC2) using a 6/7/8 Elation balloon dilated to 8 mm (3 inflations, 60 seconds each).\nStent Removal: After excision and dilation, the RML was patent and the foreign body/old stent (iCAST 7mm x 16mm) was visualized.\nIt was grasped with rat tooth forceps and removed en bloc.\nHemostasis Bleeding/oozing noted from the RML was treated with multiple modalities including cold saline, TXA, epinephrine, and electrocautery/coagulation.\nElectrocautery: Probe used on forced coag mode (2-5 sec duration) for ablation/coagulation.\nNew Stent Placement To prevent recurrence of the stent being swallowed, a longer stent was initially selected.\nTrial 1: iCAST 8mm x 22mm deployed; blocked off the RLL and was subsequently removed en bloc.\nTrial 2: iCAST 6mm x 16mm placed; noted to be too proximal and subsequently removed en bloc.\nFinal Placement: iCAST 6mm x 16mm stent was placed in the RML and seated appropriately.\nPost-Deployment Dilation: Balloon dilation performed at RML Carina (RC2) through the stent using a 6/7/8 Elation balloon dilated to 8 mm (1 inflation, 30 seconds) to seat the stent .\nConclusion The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.\nThe patient was extubated in the operating room and transported to the recovery room in stable condition.\nSPECIMENS\n\niCAST 6mm x 16mm stent (Pathology) \nRML BAL (Cell count, Microbiology/Cultures/Viral/Fungal, Cytology) \nRML Endobronchial Biopsy (Pathology) \n\nIMPRESSION / PLAN\n\n79-year-old female presenting for evaluation of airway stenosis.\nPatient's RML was closed off around the prior iCAST stent; the RML was reopened and the stent removed.\nNew iCAST stent (6mm x 16mm) placed successfully.\n\nFollow-up pathology and BAL results.\nDoxycycline 100mg 1 tab PO BID for 7 days.\n\nRepeat bronchoscopy in 3 weeks for re-evaluation.\n"}
