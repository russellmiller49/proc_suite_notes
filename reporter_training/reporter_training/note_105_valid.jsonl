The RUL bronchus shows evidence of healing with fibrin exudates and desired granulation tissue.\n\nStent Integrity: The stent is perhaps mildly undersized, but there are no signs of migration nor significant granulation over the struts.\n\nRight Lung: There is mild granulation tissue remaining in the donor RMS and BI, overlying the RML take-off, and overlying the RB6 take-off.
